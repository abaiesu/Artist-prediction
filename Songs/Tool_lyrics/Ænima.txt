// Stinkfist //

Something has to change.
Un-deniable dilemma.
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear.

Constant over-stimulation numbs me
But I would not want you
Any other way.

Just not enough.
I need more.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
I said
I don't want it.
I just need it.
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.

Finger deep within the borderline.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
Relax, turn around and take my hand.

I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure.
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way.

Blend and balance
Pain and comfort
Deep within you
'Til you will not want me any other way.

But it's not enough.
I need more.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
I said
I don't want it.
I just need it.
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.

Knuckle deep inside the borderline.
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.
Relax. Slip away.

(Chupa minha pica pichu)
(Chupa minha pica pinto)

(Chupa minha pica pinto)

(Relax, relax, relax, relax)

There's something kinda sad about
The way that things have come to be.
Desensitized to everything.
What became of subtlety?

Now how can this mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?

I'll keep digging
'Til I feel something.

Elbow deep inside the borderline.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
Shoulder deep within the borderline.
Relax. Turn around and take my hand.

// Eulogy //

He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.

He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.

We're gonna miss him.
We're gonna miss him.

Yeah, so long.
We wish you well.
Told us how you weren't afraid to die.
Well, so long.
Don't cry, yeah,
Or feel too down.
Not all martyrs see divinity.
But at least you tried.

Standing above the crowd,
He had a voice that was strong and loud.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.

We're gonna miss him.
We're gonna miss him.

Yeah, no way, yeah, to recall
What it was that you had said to me,
Like I care at all.

But it was so loud.
You sure could yell.
Took a stand on every little thing
And so loud.

You could be the one who saves me from my own existence
Warn while some child might chill, nine-one-two

I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone symbol on you. So he bashes his skull through the window while looking out to the sea. Like torment of my ego. And we're amused by this

Yeah, standing above the crowd,
He had a voice that was strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so eager to identify with
Someone above the ground,
Someone who seemed to feel the same,
Someone prepared to lead the way,
And someone who would die for me.

Will you? Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fucking lie.

Don't you step out of line.
Don't you step out of line.
Don't you step out of line.
Don't you fucking lie.

You claimed all this time that you would die for me.
Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?

He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.
He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.

Come down.
Get off your fucking cross.
We need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr.

To ascend you must die.
You must be crucified
For our sins and our lies.
Goodbye...

// H. //

What's coming through is alive.
What's holding up is a mirror.
But what's singing songs is a snake it is
Looking to turn my piss to wine.

They're both totally void of hate,
And killing me just the same.

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been.
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again.

And I feel this coming over like a storm again.
Considerately.

Venomous voice, tempts me,
Drains me, bleeds me,
Leaves me cracked and empty.
Drags me down like some sweet gravity.

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been.
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again.

And I feel this coming over like a storm again now [2x]

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,
Considerately killing me. [4x]

Without the skin here
Beneath the storm,
Under these tears now
The walls came down.

As the snake is drowned
As I look in his eyes,
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times.

I could have cried then.
I should have cried then.

And as the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
And will die.
It's all right.
I don't mind. [3x]

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,

And considerately killing me. [3x]

// Forty-Six & 2 //

Join in my, join in my child,
And listen, I've been digging through my old numb shadow...

My shadow's
Shedding skin
I've been picking
Scabs again.
I'm down
Digging through
My old muscles
Looking for a clue.

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been.
I've been wallowing in my own confused and insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in.
I wanna feel the changes coming down.
I wanna know what I've been hiding in
My shadow.
My shadow.

Change is coming through my shadow.
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again.

Join in my
Join in my child
My shadow moves
Closer to meaning

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been.
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic, insecure delusions.

I wanna feel the change consume me,
Feel the outside turning in.
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured in
My shadow
My shadow

Change is coming.
Now is my time.
Listen to my muscle memory.
Contemplate what I've been clinging to.
Forty-six & 2 ahead of me.

I choose to live and to grow,
Take and give and to move,
Learn and love and to cry,
Kill and die and to be paranoid and to lie,
Hate and fear and to do
What it takes to move through.

I choose to live and to lie,
Kill and give and to die,
Learn and love and to do
What it takes to step through.

See my shadow changing,
Stretching up and over me.
Soften this old armor.
Hoping I can clear the way
By stepping through my shadow,
Coming out the other side.
Step into the shadow.
Forty-six & 2 are just ahead of me.

// Hooker With A Penis //

I met a boy wearing Van, 501,
And a dope Beastie T,
Nipple rings
New tattoos that claimed that he
Was OGT,
Back from '92,
From the first EP.

And in between sips of Coke
He told me that he thought
We were sellin' out,
Layin' down,
Suckin' up to the man.

Well now I've got some advice for you, little buddy.
Before you point the finger you should know that I'm the man,
And if I'm the man, then you're the man, and he's the man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass.

All you know about me is what I've sold you, dumb fuck.
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name.
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit, then you bought one.

So I've got some advice for you, little buddy.
Before you point your finger you should know that I'm the man,
If I'm the fuckin' man then you're the fuckin' man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass.

All you know about me is what I've sold you, dumb fuck.
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name.
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit, then you bought one.

All you read and wear or see and hear on TV is a product waiting for your fatass dirty dollar

So, shut up and buy, buy, buy my new record
Buy, buy, buy,
Send more money
Fuck you, buddy.
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy.

// Jimmy //

What was it like to see,
The face of your own stability,
Suddenly look away,
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?

Eleven and she was gone.
Eleven is when we waved good-bye.
Eleven is standing still,
Waiting for me to free him,
By coming home.

Moving me with a sound.
Opening me within a gesture.
Drawing me down and in,
Showing me where it all began,
Eleven.

He was too scarred to realize,
You were the voice that's been calling me back home.

Under a dead Ohio sky,
Eleven has been and will be waiting,
Defending his light and wondering,
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping lost and numb
I'm so glad that I have found you.
I am wide awake and heading,
Home.

I wish that I could see you,
Turn and run to play.
Dreams are fading,
Carry my ancient soul.

Carry me into the light.
Aim your body heavenly,
Enduring a memory.
I'll come to your light,
Hold your light.
Hold your light where I can see it,

Hold it,
High.

Hold your light,
Eleven, lead me through each gentle step,
By step,
By inch by loaded memory,
I'll move,
To heal,
As soon as pain allows so we can,
Reunite,
And both move on together.

Hold,
Your light,
Eleven lead me through each gentle step,
By step,
By inch by loaded memory 'til
One
And one are one,
Eleven.
So glow,
Child,
Glow.
I'm heading back home...

// Pushit //

I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Take care not to make me enter
If I do, we both may disappear

Know that I will choke until I swallow
Choke this infant here before me
What is this but my reflection?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?

But you're
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
You still love me, you still love me
But you didn't need to push it on me
You still love me, you still love me
But you didn't need to push it on me

Rest your trigger on my finger
Bang my head upon the fault line
You better take care not to make me enter
'Cause if I do, we both may disappear

But you're
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
You still love me, you still love me
But you didn't need to push it on me
You're pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me

I'm slipping back into the gap again
I'm alive when you're touching me
Alive when you're shoving me down, yeah
But I'd trade it all
For just a little peace of mind

Push it on me, push it on me
Push it on me, push it on me
You're pushing, and shoving, and scrambling
To keep my feet flat on the ground

I am somewhere I don't wanna be, yeah
Push me somewhere I don't wanna be
You put me somewhere I don't wanna be
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see
Never want to see that place again

Saw that gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you, as well, my dear

If when I say I might fade like a sigh if I stay
You minimize my movement anyway
I must persuade you another way

Pushing and shoving
Pushing and shoving
Pushing me
There's no love in fear

Yeah, I'm staring down the hole again
Hands around my back again
Survival is my only friend
Terrified of what may come, yeah

Remember I'll always love you
As I claw your fucking throat away
It will end no other way
It will end no other way

// Ænema //

Some say the end is near.
Some say we'll see Armageddon soon.
Certainly hope we will.
I sure could use a vacation from this bullshit three-ring circus sideshow of freaks.

Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call L.A.
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away.
Any fucking time. Any fucking day.
Learn to swim, see you down in Arizona Bay.

Fret for your figure
And fret for your latte
And fret for your lawsuit
And fret for your hairpiece
And fret for your Prozac
And fret for your pilot
And fret for your contract
And fret for your car.

It's a bullshit three-ring circus sideshow of freaks.

Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call L.A.
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away.
Any fucking time. Any fucking day.
Learn to swim, see you down in Arizona Bay.

Some say a comet will fall from the sky.
Followed by meteor showers and tidal waves.
Followed by fault lines that cannot sit still.
Followed by millions of dumbfounded dip shits.

And some say the end is near.
Some say we'll see Armageddon soon.
Certainly hope we will
I sure could use a vacation from this stupid shit, silly shit, stupid shit.

One great big festering neon distraction,
I've a suggestion to keep you all occupied.

Learn to swim.
Learn to swim.
Learn to swim.

'Cause mom's gonna fix it all soon.
Mom's comin' 'round to put it back the way it ought to be.

Learn to swim. [repeat]

Fuck L Ron Hubbard
And fuck all his clones.
Fuck all these gun-toting
Hip gangster wannabes.

Learn to swim. [repeat]

Fuck retro anything.
Fuck your tattoos.
Fuck all you junkies
And fuck your short memory.

Learn to swim. [repeat]

Fuck smiley glad-hands
With hidden agendas.
Fuck these dysfunctional
Insecure actresses.

Learn to swim. [repeat]

'Cause I'm praying for rain
I'm praying for tidal waves
I wanna see the ground give way.
I wanna watch it all go down.

Mom, please flush it all away.
I wanna see it go right in and down.
I wanna watch it go right in.
Watch you flush it all away.

Time to bring it down again.
Don't just call me pessimist.
Try and read between the lines.
And I can't imagine why you wouldn't welcome any change, my friend.

I wanna see it come down.
Bring it down
Suck it down.
Flush it down.

// Third Eye //

[Spoken by Bill Hicks:]
See, I think drugs have done some good things for us, I really do. And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, do me a favour: go home tonight, take all your albums, all your tapes and all your CDs, and burn 'em. 'Cause you know what, the musicians who made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years... real fucking high on drugs.

Today young men on acid realise that all matter is purely energy condensed into a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death. Life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.

It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom is what it is, OK. Keep that in mind at all times. Thank you.

Dreaming of that face again.
It's bright and blue and shimmering.
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes.

On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye.

In... out... in... out... in... out...

A child's rhyme stuck in my head.
It said that life is but a dream.
I've spent so many years in question
to find I've known this all along.

"So good to see you.
I've missed you so much.
So glad it's over.
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play.
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play.
Why are you running?"

Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me.
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun.
I stick my hand into the shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand.
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been.
I do not recognize the vessel,
But the eyes seem so familiar.
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song...

"So good to see you.
I've missed you so much.
So glad it's over.
I've missed you so much.
Came out to watch you play.
Why are you running away?"

Prying open my third eye.
Prying open my third eye.
Prying open my third eye.
Prying open my third eye.

So good to see you once again.
I thought that you were hiding.
And you thought that I had run away.
Chasing the tail of dogma.

I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were.

I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were.

So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me.
you thought that I had run away.
Chasing a trail of smoke and the reason.

Prying open my third eye.
