// Sweat //

I'm sweating,
and breathing
and staring and thinking
and sinking
deeper.
It's almost like I'm swimming.

The sun is burning hot again
on the hunter
and the fisherman,
and Iâm trying to remember when,
but it makes me dizzy.

Seems like I've been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I'm slipping
into a dream within a dream.

Must be the way you whisper.

The sun is setting cool again.
I'm the thinker
and the fisherman
and I'm trying to remember when
but it makes me dizzy.
and I'm sweating,
and breathing,
and staring and thinking
and sinking deeper
and it's almost like I'm swimming.

Seems like I've been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I'm slipping
into a dream within a dream.
It's the way you whisper.

Seems like I've been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I'm slipping
into a dream within a dream.
Itâs the way you whisper

drags me under
takes me home

// Part Of Me //

I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself

I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself

You are a part of me

You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me

Give it up

You don't speak
You don't judge
You can't leave
You can't hurt me
You're just here for
Me to use

I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself
I know you well, better than one might think
I know you better than I know myself

I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you best, better than one might think
It's time for you to make a sacrifice
It's time to die a little. Give it up

I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself

A part of me

// Cold And Ugly //

âThrow that Bob Marley wanna-be motherfucker outta hereâ

FADE

Underneath the skin and jewelry,
hidden in her words and eyes
is a wall that's cold and ugly
and she's scared as hell.
Trembling at the thought of feeling.
Wide awake and keeping distance.
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.

I am frightened too
I am frightened
Oh oh oh.

Trembling at the thought of feeling
Wide awake and keeping distance
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.

I am frightened too
I am frightened

Wide awake and
keeping distance from my soul.
Wide awake and
keeping distance from my soul

FADE

Underneath the skin and jewelry,
hidden in her words and eyes
is a wall that's cold and ugly
and she's scared as hell.
Trembling at the thought of feeling.
Wide awake and keeping distance.
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.

I am frightened too
I am frightened too
I am scared like you
I am frightened

// Jerk-Off //

[Maynard:]
Used to be a bunch of assholes that lived in this part of the building here, but we systematically removed them like you would any kind of termite or roach

Someone told me once
That there's a right and wrong
Punishment was cure for those
Who dare to cross the line

But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you
And maybe it takes longer to catch a total asshole
I'm tired of waiting

Someone told me once
That there's a right and wrong
Punishment was cure for those
Who dare to cross the line

But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you

And maybe it's just bullshit
I should play God
And shoot you myself

Tired of waiting

Consequences dictate
Our course of action
And it doesn't matter what's right
It's only wrong if you get caught
If consequences dictate
My course of action
I should, I should play God
And just shoot you myself
Tired of waiting

Die now

Shoot it
Kick it
Fuck it
Shoot you in your fucking head

// Opiate //

Choices always were a problem for you.
What you need is someone strong to guide you.
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow,
What you need is someone strong to guide you..
Like me, like me, like me, like me

If you want to get your soul to heaven, trust in me.
Now don't you judge or question.
You are broken now, but faith can heal you.
Just do everything I tell you to do.

Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow.
What you need is someone strong to guide you.
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow.
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you.

My God's will becomes me.
When he speaks, he speaks through me.
He has needs like I do.
We both want to rape you.

[2x]
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now
Open my eyes and blind me with your light now

If you want to get your soul to heaven, trust in me.
Now don't you judge or question.
You are broken now, but faith can heal you.
Just do everything I tell you to do.

[2x]

Open my eyes, blind me with your light now.

// The Gaping Lotus Experience //

I had a friend once he took some acid
Now he thinks he's a fire engine
It's okay until he pisses on your lighter
Kinda smells kinda cool kinda funny anyway

satan, satan, satan...

I had a friend once he took some ecstasy
Tried to marry me and every one in the room
He was sort of loving kinda caring, 
kinda tried to fuck my lazy boy
It got a bit messy all over the curtains,
arm chair covers, throw pillows, and carpeting

satan, satan, satan...

I'm getting bored again...
