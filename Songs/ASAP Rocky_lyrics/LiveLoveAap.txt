Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga (Uh,) but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga (Uh,) but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss

Uh
Stone cold love, rose gold slugs
I could afford it, I imported stone cold drugs
Stone cold, rolling stone, I'm a stoned nigga
Write it on my tombstone, I was stoned, nigga
Don't remember me as a wannabe New Orleans nigga
Slash lean sipping, Tennessee nigga, nah
Influenced by Houston, hear it in my music (Yeah)
A trill nigga to the truest, show you how to do this
My all gold grills give her cold chills
Said she got a coke feel 'cause I'm so trill
Two dope boy scales, but I sold pills
No deal, put her on her feet, toenails
Them vampires, them bloodsuckers, them thirsty killers
We 'bout it, 'bout it, we rowdy, rowdy, that Percy Miller
For really real, we chilly chill, don't sport Chinchilla
No bounty hunters, I'm 'bout to killa, I'm bout my skrilla
Give me the title, then give me the cash, fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash, stealing my swag, niggas is wickity wickity wack
Like Kriss Kross, her lip gloss, slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch boss, Cristal, we smoking then thinking then burning that hash
Puff it and pass, making it last, walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs, making 'em crash, took in a section ain't giving it back
Fuck the money, fuck the fame, this is real life
An insight to my trill life, Clams

Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga, boy, how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling it

// Peso //

I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as your President
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing
'Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing

This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos (Pesos)
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos (Pesos)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
'Cause every day we on our pesos

Yo, yo, yo, your bitch just said I'm hot, man, I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's
Popping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe
Inhale, exhale, cocaine, X pills
Import, export, Harlem catching rec still
So mami, show me how that neck feel (Feel)
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill

This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
'Cause every day we on our pesos
'Cause every day we on our pesos
'Cause every day we on our pesos

// Bass //

So recognize that shit, you better fuckin' recognize that fuckin' name right now
I recognize, I recognize
A$AP
Recognize that shit, A$AP
A... fucking $AP
I recognize
You don't play no fuckin' fear in my heart

These other niggas so-so, they open off my mojo
Spanish Sophie with a half a kilo by her cho-cho
Blow it out your culo, who got dough on the smoke though
My partner had cinco now we blowin' on that ocho
Bozos love my rose gold, purple got me slow-mo
Stuntin' like I'm Dorothy but my rubies in my gold though
What you think this four for, these niggas must be loco
Steppin' on these bricks and for your fix so call me Toto
Follow me, follow me, follow me now

Now I'mma come through getting down
Got a new Cadillac with a diamond in the back
Got a bitch and she bad with about a hundred tats
Got my goons on deck, and we got a hundred straps
What you know about that, got me swaggin' to the max
Everybody know we got the shit and baggages to match
Better come correct, fuck what the basis is
Gold grills like a set of new braces

Why they comment on my set though, they lookin' cause my neck gold
And I let that Tec show... hear that echo?
Let go, that medal, .38 special, to your threshold
Niggas actin' petro, like they sexual, was metro
Bunch of bad bitches fuckin' out on tour
Like it through the back door, give it to her raw
Shimmy shimmy ya: ODB, ODB
Fuckin' other niggas' broads: OPP, OPP

Comin' down stuntin' like a bitch, bitches on my dick
On the set and they like the nicotine to cigarette
How they fiending for a nigga got these hoes up on my sack
Got my niggas in the back, couple bitches in the bed
ASAP where it's at, where that weed, how that cake
Bitches all up in my face, back back, give me space
'Cause you know how we do it, niggas scream ASAP
Aye Clams nigga, tell me where that bass at?

Bass, uhh!

// Wassup //

Clams Casino, A$AP (Wassup)
See me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup (Wassup)
See me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup (Wassup)

Back once again, sipping Henn, mixed with juice and gin
Bitches in, couple lady friends countin' Benjamins
Spinners spin, on the 20-twins that Mercedes-Benz
Dividends made a change of plans well that all depends
Shout-out my parolees and I smoke that OG
Kush mothafuck the police, all my niggas rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street, sipping on that codeine
We hustle hard no sleep, your bitch loose that's no leash
I ain't talking 'bout no money, I ain't talking 'bout no cars
Talking 'bout no diamonds cause that shit is a façade
Times is really hard, I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are

I be that pretty mothafucka', Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second

// Brand New Guy //

[A$AP Rocky:]
You know us big mouth Harlem niggas don't know how to act

These dead in the street industry mothafuckas
Talkin' 'bout we can't eat, talking 'bout we brand new guys
Tell them niggas "Suck a dick!"

I'm camo'd down to my boxers, gold teeth, a Bathing Ape
It's animals in my projects, like monkeys, orangutans
Banana clip on that chopper, I hold heat, bangers bang
(Let Chiquita speak) Bet it keep the peace, that Lil B, brrangadang
I don't care if you blue or you red flagging
Hair swinging, my pants sagging
Hoes all on my bandwagon, your bitch gagging, she jet lagging
All my cuz niggas, what's cracking?
All my blood niggas, what's popping?
I ain't set tripping, I just happen
To know who click-clacking, you mismatching
Fuck swagging, you been jacking, fuck fly, I am fashion
Tryna cop that Benz wagon, my bitch drive it, my friends crash it
Niggas threat with the chit-chatting, see a nigga don't shit happen
I'm finna blow on that Bin Laden, so talk money, pig latin
(Suck my fuckin' dick, bitch!)

Pull it off through the city like "errt"
Seen that ho nigga like "errr," hopped up on a nigga like murk
Put that pussy nigga in a purse
He wouldn't be the first, cover him with dirt (Yeah, uh, shit)
Put him in the ground, he was down to Earth
A napped up nigga, I been down since birth
Backpack full of random work
With two bad hoes, I'll teach you how to jerk
(Teach you how to jerk?) Swaggin' in my Js
Pop me a pill and throw that pussy a rave (Pussy a rave)
My prerogative ways
Nappy chin hairs with the brand new fade (Yeah)
Brand new nigga with the brand new venue
Sold that bitch out, shoulda made that ho bigger
Killing careers make these cupcakes remember
My objective is to serve your agenda
Biggie and Nas put they ass in a blender
Sprinkle some 50 and came out this nigga
Equipped with a gat and a dick in your mouth
Balls in my hands and your bitch in my house
Twisting up weed, I'm digging her out
Just filling her out
Do all that shit you be talking about
While you gone? Shit, Netflix on your couch

Bitch, I'm a boss, pulled up clean, don't you hear the exhaust?
Got my tie on, gripping on my iron on who I'm 'bout to fire on
Rap game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I rap for?
Crack game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I trap for?
Ridin' 'round with that mask on
Like a MAC attack when that strap on
Like a Shaq attack on that backboard, clap on, clap off
Blue pit in my back yard, red nose my bad broad
Titan full of that hydro, pretty nigga, no catwalk
Big burner in your big mouth, pussy niggas suck lead off
I pull it up then skirt off, vodka shots, he smeared off
40 ounce of that Cristal Rosé, that Rick Ross
Got it jumping like Kriss Kross, mismatching, no jigsaw
No horseplay when we quick draw, pussy nigga get a tit job
Hands up, stick your mans up, your time's up, the new brand's up
Q!

[SpaceGhostPurrp:]
Back in this bitch mothafucka', yeah it's me

Sipping on gin, living in sin, lean in the trunk
RIP to Screw, rest in peace to Pimp C
Shout out to the H and that fucking SUC
My fucking brain is purple, nigga

Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (ASAP, swag, swag, swag)
I said everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

It be that pretty mothafucka' sipping that throwed
Gripping my pistol, my chrome
Hidden to hit you then splitting your wig into something
I spit it and flip it like Bone
Niggas ain't ready for the flow switch
Only Harlem nigga on his Bone shit
Tippin 4s since back in 06
Won't you see a nigga getting throwed bitch?
Two middle fingers to the showbiz
Cause they selfish and they show bus'
Cause they shelf kids and it's hopeless
Career dying quicker than a goldfish
I be the fly young fella (Yeah) Maison Martin Margiela (Uh)
Bitches Cinderellas under my umbrella, I go and tell her

Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
I said everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[A$AP Nast:]
Uh, all hell here, bitch it's Satan talking
Told her to take it off, give her the D, she take the offense
Skinny nigga balling, trip but never falling
Who said to make it rain (rain)? Bitch I make it pouring
I'm a cake-o-saurus, go study my nature
Big chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature
Fuck what you saying, no way
A hater don't faze a gangster
Brought up in danger, all about paper
Smoking on purple, bitch, I'm dangerous, nasty crazy
90s baby, momma I made it
Up to the sky, goodbye to the pavement
Hoes get caught in amazement
I'm stuck in my ways
So fuck 'em up, I fuck 'em and duck 'em for days
What more can I say? (Yeah) I'm chasing this paper
That's purple, nigga

// Get Lit //

[A$AP Rocky:]
I get so high, I touch the sky 'til I can't even function
I get so high, I fuck around and wanna leave the function

Afterparty with my niggas, slumber party with your bitch
Finna hit a lick, 10-56, takin' sips, let the syrup sit
Let it get to mix, every day, we gettin' gettin' lit
That 'Purrp purp when I get lit, 'methazine, tell 'em sip this
I'm on that Memphis, that 666, Trip Six shit, bitches
A fifty box of them Swishers, gold slabs on them sixes
In a backseat full of bitches tryna hit licks, we gon' get lit

Pass the mothafuckin' Swisher, pour some mothafuckin' liquor
For my mothafuckin' niggas who ain't wit us, keep it trilla'
My gold teeth, my french braids, getting throwed since 10th grade
Wealth is in the mind, not the pocket, if that's the case, then I been paid
Herringbone chain, my gold frames, my Cartiers, you small change
You bitch made, I'm old school, like gem stars and switchblades
I spit game, I get paid, a pimp game
I be, I be that pretty muthafucka, A$AP is just my nickname
(I'm comin' down when I'm tippin' on them 4's
Cause we shittin' on these, shittin' on these niggas and these hoes)
Cause that purp shit I sip up, your bitch chose, you slipped up
I get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up
Top of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind
We runnin', we runnin', we gunnin', we gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time
Them bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe
A weirdo but I'm real though

[A$AP Twelvyy:]
All these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock 'em
Not a red light or a city cop that can stop 'em
Going broke is not an option, always on that cash flow
She used to call me asshole, now she drop that ass low
Fuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel slash coke
A$AP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow
I slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up
That's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch
I'm headed to the future, Twelvyy ain't no loser
Mixing up that syrup, call it Punky Brewster
I'm slurring wussup, don't tell me to shut up
I ain't tryna start shit, but man I'm really fucked up
I lucked up, I see it as a come up
I'm on my job man, I see you when the sun's up
Huh, young niggas run everything
A$AP to the top and these bitches love everything

[A$AP Nast:]
God bless America, my flow is scarier
Style wild like my nigga Common after Erykah
Your bitch, I'm in bed with her, head so good
Make a nigga feel good to the point I wanna marry her
But I be on my pimping shit, check out my limp and shit
I be getting money, getting money, can you dig it, bitch?
Hoes get on my pimping ship all aboard, all aboard
East coast mothafuckas making all the noise, all the noise
I know you niggas heard of us, Raf Simon murderers
Fashion killa' word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya
Still sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in
Kitchen chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches in
New York Nasty flow, that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Hen
Businessman, middle finger to your fucking business, man
Great adventure shit, rollercoasting take a flick of this
Motion picture shit, bitch I grind like a skater do
Always strive and prosper, Rock what level we gon' take it to?

// Keep It G //

[Chace Infinite:]

[A$AP Rocky:]
This is music for the villains, sophisticated children
A$AP in the house, now we're finna run the building
Working never chilling 'til I get a million
To the ceiling, now my niggas gunning for a billion
They ask me how I'm living, I say I'm gold grilling
Niggas acting different, mothafuck' a friendship
These bitches is persistent, talking 'bout I'm distant
Lost my mind a long time ago to find it, need forensics
For instance, I get-get my dick licked
Red bone, complexion like a piglet, kiss-kiss
Fuck Ace, we sip Cris, afford it cause I'm getting it
Drip-drip, the thought of it is ignorant, isn't it? (Hahahah)
I'm ticklish, stunting is my business
Swagging on you hoes and I'm shitting on you niglets
So little homie, peep game
Cause these other rappers lame and don't care to do the same
Young blood

Fuck what you say, nigga I'ma keep it G (Uh, uh, uh)

[SpaceGhostPurrp:]
Well, let me tell you 'bout a nigga like me

She wanna take a dick ride, we slide
Straight to the telly, shaking her jelly with my dick inside
Hit it in motion, in slow motion, hit it
Nigga she open, nigga I'm poking, split it
With it, get it right there in the bed
Open up your legs, let me beat that pussy red
Fuck what you said, I'ma still do me
Groupies, be sucking and fucking, porno movie
Do we have a problem in here?
Look a nigga in the eye as I notice the fear
I am severe, my style is hella sharp like a spear
All I do is sit back and think with the 40 beer
And you gotta feel the funk
While the bass plays loud, booming all in your damn trunk

[SpaceGhostPurrp & A$AP Rocky:]
(Ay, young blood) Stay true to the game
Fuck them lames, keep it motherfuckin' G
(Ay, young blood) Nigga I'ma tell you

This is for my old head, gon' turn your speakers up
"Rocky, where you been?" I been tryna make my ends meet
So I can cop that Bathing Ape or Jeremy Scott or 10 Deep
Bottles full of Rose, riding in the Benz jeep
Blowing money fast, now I'm finna think I'm (Big Meech)
I met with my old head, we sat for a while
We rolled a couple Swishers, we chat for a while
I said, "I'm just on my grind, I come to Houston all the time"
He said, "What's been goin' down in your New York state of mind?"
Fine, you ever got days you feel like giving up
Like how you gon' eat when this gig is up?
When the chips is down and the jig is up
But I don't give a fuck, roll another Swisher up
Cause I just came here down South so I could get these pounds out
And move my mother nice somewhere, nothin' closer than a townhouse
And my beats banging, kicking harder than a roundhouse
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out

Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight
Cause life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight

Now my old head old age, bald head, Rogaine
Code red codeine, nose red, cocaine
Pimpin bitches since lemon chicken, shrimp lo-mein
Gold chains, afros, platforms, Soul Train
And he told me 'bout that rapping, trapping in the old days
When Pac hung with Shock before that rat-tat-tat-tat, nose rings
And I'm so high, I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane
We sip slow, we slow swang
We tip fours, on chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang, hold up, that's my old dame
Pick it up, I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back
She said, "Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home, leave the drugs alone and stick to rap
Just don't come back flossin' 'cause that type of shit'll get you clapped"

Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight
Cause life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight

I'm riding down, coming down for my old head (Yeah, yeah)
Junkied up, chunk the deuce for my old head (Alright)
Sitting slow, riding down with my old head (Yeah)
Bury niggas talking down on my old head (Alright, yeah)
Riding down, riding down with my old head (Yeah)
Chunk the deuce, give it up for my old head (Yeah)
Riding down, riding 'round with my old head (Alright, alright)
For my old head, for my old head

Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight
Cause life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight

// Acid Drip //

Feeling outta place, plus it's getting kinda late
Tryna make it home safe and not get raped, where you live?
Tina tummy ache, Gina got the funny face
Mona's sniffing dope, so her dome is leaning on your rib
I bet you wish you had a Benz cause you just helped your friends
Flag a taxi, now you walking not too far from your crib
Craving for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
Said you feeling flabbergasted, you just had to have it
Made your way to 7th Ave, flagged a yellow cab
Now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
Black kid, french braids and he keep the potent
Hold ya purse don't trust him cause his teeth is golden
Dice rolling reefer blowing in the streets he smoking
Blowing weed while police patrolling
Acid strips, purple drink you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip

Hands on her thighs, kiss on the lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip
Hands on her thighs, kiss on the lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip

"I'm so happy, you know um
You know I looked at the crowd and you know
I look at my fans, I look at their faces, they expressions
And I know that damn well, we are some partying mothafuckas"

[A$AP Rocky:]
Tired of these rappers, tired of these jackers
I'm tired of these dances by these fucking backpackers
And I'm sick of all these hipsters, I'm sick of phony niggas
I'm sticking to these bitches cause I'm sick of all these sisters
I'm sick and tired of tryna survive
I'm sick and tired of my environment
Sick and tired of feeling deprived
I'm one of a kind when in my climate
Sick and tired of your façade
And all of your lying and your diamonds
Basically, I'm tired of feeling sick and tired
A$AP (A$AP) born in money makin' Manhattan
Every nigga on my block wanna be a Main Attrakion
Shout my nigga Squadda, shout my nigga Mondre
If you disrespect them niggas then I'm polishin' the nine-trey
And I'm coming to your casa for your madre and your padre
Comprende? Most of these niggas been gay or they strange
They say I sound like Andre mixed with Kanye, little bit of Max
A little bit of Wiz, little bit of that, little bit of this, get off my dick

I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'm a down to Earth nigga, we could kick it
Won't you take a hit with me, hit with me? Uh
Take a hit with me, hit with me, uh
Ain't on stage, behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Won't you come and take a sip with me, sip with me? Yeah
Take a sip with me, sip with me, yeah

[Squadda B:]
Ay, ay, ay, once again, Mr. Back Selling Crack
It's an honor keeping real nigga music on the map
Street raps, new face, sampling with no credits
Doubting myself cause I don't think the world can relate
To my surprise everyone does, so have faith
Half of the other side don't live it, they push play
The young illest alive, Harlem World to the Bay
It feels good waking up to money in the bank
Cause last year, it was shoebox and lint
I only write raps just to give you niggas hints
Every verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney
My album coming November, that's twenty years of memory
And that's assuming I'ma live that long
If I don't, don't cry cause I ain't live that wrong
Just an artist in a purest form, I live that song
An artist in the purest form, I live that song, Bambino

[A$AP Rocky:]
I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'm a down to Earth nigga, we could kick it
Won't you take a hit with me, hit with me? Uh
Take a hit with me, hit with me, uh
Ain't on stage, behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Won't you come and take a sip with me, sip with me? Yeah
Take a sip with me, sip with me, yeah

[Mondre M.A.N:]
Okay, hold up, ay, why fuss? I'd rather fuck
Treat her like my enemy, I just wanna bust
Seven deuce, waiting on the bus
Before the boys bend the corner tryna make a bust
Tryouts, I'm tryna make the bucks
Purple and the green got me on stuck
So I two-step, move my feet and keep it pushing
Always bouncing back, gotta keep the cushion
And that's something fat, like eating all the pudding
A$AP, we got a slap, bruh, good looking
Fuck that, A$AP where I come from
456, Ice City slums
Weed in my pocket, coke in his tongues
Buying Swisher Sweets, no more honey buns
Fresh white tee, bright like the sun
Only nigga round here rocking Мишка

[A$AP Rocky:]
I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'm a down to Earth nigga, we could kick it

[Ol' Dirty Bastard:]
"This go out to all the rappers, this go out to the little darlings
The little kids running around in the schoolyards, I love you
Keep it good, keep it good kids cause you know I love you
I'mma always love you, forever"

// Demons //

I just, I just live
I live day by day, fighting demons

I smoked away my brain, I think I'm going dumb
Cocaine up on my gums, I think they're going numb
I'm having stomach pains, now I'm throwing up
Cause I'm a microphone fiend, give me the bass
Give me the beat, and let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream
Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King, with a dream
That one day that my team, we can make it with this rapping
Now we swagging, making money in Manhattan, trick, what's happening?
They try to intellect with indirection just to test you
A rebel until my death, it's in my flesh, it's in my vessels
Fuck the clique you with, I'm finna fuck the bitch you next to
Fuck a metrosexual, suck a dick, I'm disrespectful
You know the kid get it, get-get sick spit
Clip spit quick split shit hit kids women
Oh, that's your girl, huh? Well, I just hit it
It's A$AP nigga, live with it, swag

Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they starting to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts

// Out Of This World //

Olympicks, Olympicks, Olympicks, Olympicks
Uh, alright

Get money addict, I'ma get "Money" tatted
Money in the attics, money in the stashes
Money in the cabinets, stuffed in the mattress
Safe full of guns, more money up in that shit
Taz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott Adidas
Maison Martin Margiela, three strap sneakers
Riding with a leecher, student and a teacher
It's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer
Thinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo
Play with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue, life is a handful
Friends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post, while I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled
Yeah I feel Rihanna, and I understand Hov
What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?
Now I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me, other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full but instead you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy, but Rocky been jiggy
Curren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate when they compare me to Drake
Could have been J. Cole if I met Jay Hov
(Who dat? ASAP) But I'm fly like I never left
You's a lie, like fly without the letter F
If hip hop is dead, fuck it, let it rest
Reincarnated through me when she resurrect
Long hair, blue jeans, live on U-Stream
High top boots like Pac in a Juice scene
No, it ain't a movie, diamonds in my new gleam
Dead tone cause the redbones is my new thing
Nigga, I do things, let the coupe sing
Niggas say I'm insane, Saddam Hussein
Niggas still jokers, me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne (Uh)
Fly kicks, my shit (Uh) yeah, I'm on that Liu Kang
I ain't bragging but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas
I'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest
And your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits
I only hear the money, so save the bullshit for the Q-tips
Swag is the coolest, my bitch is the rudest
My jeweler is Jewish and my wrist is the bluest
And I get it poppin' on the block like Whoo Kid
A$AP standing on the block like the new kids

Uhh, A$AP nigga, uhh, uhh
Alright, yeah
A$AP nigga, uhh
Alright, alright

// Sandman //

Uh, yeah
Welcome back
We've been missin' you
This what they been waiting for
Crash Course (Rest in peace)
Uh

My mind like George Lucas, I think like Stanley Kubrick
House full of eucalyptus, that boy straight mucus
So, let's get straight to it, my chain is this humongous
Permanent bling my tooth is, yeah, I'm a strange human
This insane jewelry collection, it'll take a week to shoot it
Record an album with Mercedes, let GQ EQ it
I think I'm Frank Lucas, slang where my boo thing school is
A straight A-student, but the brain stupid
Leave it all in the past now, walls talkin' back now
Back to the wall, with your wall to the back, don't back down
Buck up, tell 'em how the fuck your mama ain't raise no bitch?
Gloves on the dashboard, mask on the lat' now
MAC on the lap, on the hip while the red-blue lights in the background
Cops wanna pat down, just pray the clip don't (Click, click)

Merci beaucoup, just like Moulin Rouge
And I know I can, can, and my spirit stand, stands
I say Voulez-Vous Coucher for eternity
Let's go meet the sandman, let our spirits dance, dance

Uh, on a skyway to Hell, with smiley face jewels
'Cause I'm a boss, I call the shots, you make the calls
'Cause if I take a L, then they gon' take the loss
If I'm on my way to Hell, then I'ma take you all
Girl, I'm not supposed to be here, still
Rap careers last three years still
I'm a G here, that's OG times three
Triple OG, still just shows I'ma be here, still act too young
Got bitches on me, and the females still let 'em be here still
At twenty-six, my nigga OD off of lean, codeine and pills
He'll be here still

Merci beaucoup, just like Moulin Rouge
And I know I can, can, and my spirit stand, stands
I say Voulez-Vous Coucher for eternity
Let's go meet the sandman, let our spirits dance, dance

Rest in peace to Yams, I done lost some friends
Until we meet again, we will forever dance, sleep
Voulez-Vous Coucher for eternity
Let's go meet the sandman, let our spirits dance, dance

Uh, yeah, yeah (I'm just)
Uh, yeah, yeah (I'm just)
