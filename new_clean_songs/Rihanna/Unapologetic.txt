// Phresh Out The Runway //

I see you walk
I hear you boy
I see you walk

Love it, then come and get it
I know that ya fucking with it
Ya see me, ya like it, huh?
Heels Givenchy, huh?
Love it, then play it back
Plus where the 40 at?
I'm fucking with cheap thrill on top of my 50 mill
He eating-the-cake killer!

Own it, but don't kill her!
My jewelers are diamond rollers!
My rock... chinchilla!
Some more raw fun, I'm rolling like rock stars
I got 50 motherfuckers in my watch with my bands down

Phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Bitch I'm phresh out the runway

Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out hold up

Venus I'm out at coast, my bitches don't know
Fuck with her, my designer drip to the fucking floor
Be out in that, they like 'em in all them honey stuffs
Monas are rolling loudies, and my bitches so Bvlgari!
Bodies of Ducattis do what the fuck you want!
I bet you niggas gon' be like "Bitch this my fucking song"
How could you be so hood, but you so fucking pop?
How could you be so fun, and sound like you selling rocks?

What's in the ching dollars?
What's on my chain dollars?
All of the bank dollars got change for small dollars
Everything plain dollars
I was in the back line, I'm standing in the bank line
You throwing up the gang signs

Phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway

Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway (I hear you boy)
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out hold up

You really wanna know how we get down
Walk up in this bitch like we own this ho
Own this ho, like we own this ho

// Diamonds //

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive

// Numb //

Ecstasy in the air
I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired
No worse for wear

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

Can't you see?
Ain't it clear
I don't care
Get closer to me
If you dare
I double dare

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

I'm plastered (dry wall)
Look me in my (eyeball)
Do I look high? (no!)
I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear
I'm tryna get closer to you
I'm motioning you to pull over, boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police and I'm looking at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
'Cause I'm sick of sniffing asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders and I can't feel my lips 'cause—

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

Gold all up in my grill, I still got mo' money

// Loveeeeeee Song //

Ain't nothing wrong with it

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love

Oh baby, I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want, baby
Come hold me tight and when I'm drowning, save me
Give it to me on a daily

Boy, lately you've been stingy with your time
Got me wondering
I'm wondering, if I'm on your mind
Boy, I just wanna be in your possession
Saying I'm the one you want
So come express it
Don't slip, don't slip
'Cause a nigga might push up on it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this?
(I-I-I) Don't put it down
(I-I-I) Don't fuck around
(I-I-I) I want you now
I want you now, oh

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression

I'm searching for my soul (Rock star)
Who ever turned you cold? (Because)
You need to let him know
I can work miracles
I'll work your physical (Physical)
And when I love you close
You can feel my heart
Beating through my clothes
Future

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love
Love and affection
Love, love
L-o-v-e-e-e and affection

Tomorrow way too far away

So get up right now

Tomorrow way too far away

Ain't scared I can take you
Can't fight the feeling
Got me fiending

Something you wanted to do all your life
There's no more waiting: tonight is the night
And it can't be wrong, not if it feels this right
Turn it up, scream it loud, yeah.

// What Now //

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Oh, oh, oh, oh! What now?

I found the one, he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love
But I'm numb again

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Please tell me
What now?

There's no one to call 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Somebody tell me
What now?

I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know oh oh why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know oh oh why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know oh oh why

So what now?

// Stay //

All along it was a fever
A cold-sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something."
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer."

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

Ooh, ooh, ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move

Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way

I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, ooh

// Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary //

[Part I: Love Without Tragedy]

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

I ask you, "What's the matter?"
You say "Oh, it's nothing at all."
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?
(Marilyn Monroe)
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen

911, it's a critical emergency, yeah
Better run-run-run
Come and charge him with the 1-4-3, yeah
Told me this world was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now it's done, done, done
And his love is no more for me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fi-fo-fum, like the sky is falling down on me
Numb-numb-numb
He so cold, he doesn't feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Go on and put him away
He's the only one-one-one I ever let get the best of me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Usually I'm the one that they cry for
But this man, he's the one that I'd die for
Mama said there's no cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?
No love, no love, no love allowed

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed

// Half Of Me //

You saw me on a television
Setting fire to all the buildings
Yeah, I guess you saw me stealing
But you've no idea what I've been needing
We talk about when we were children
Not the kind of kid you believe in
You saw me on a television
Saw me on a television

But that's just the half of it
Yeah, you saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it

You saw me on a television
Hanging out my dirty linen
You're entitled to your own opinion
Sit and shake your head at my decisions
I guess the kind of songs that I've been singing
Make it seem as if I'm always winning
But you saw me on a television
Yeah, you saw me on a television

But that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it

Oh, you know me
I'm the life of the party
Beautiful people surround me
Everybody falling in love
Oh, you know me
Everybody knows that I'm crazy
Sticks and stones, they never break me
And I'm the type that don't give a fuck

And that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it
Yeah, this is the life I live
And that's just the half of it
Yeah, you saw the half of it
And this is the life I live
You saw the half of it
Only the... half of it
Yeah, whoa

Saw me on a television
Saw me on a television

Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
