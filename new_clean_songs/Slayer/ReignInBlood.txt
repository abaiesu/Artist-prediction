Album: ReignInBlood

// Aggressive Perfector //

Follow me, I'll lead the way; your fears will soon overtake
Hide your infinite tears inside, it seeks your smallest break
Screaming as if nothing helps, you press on to survive
Playing out the fantasies of a force that keeps you alive

He'll have you down on your knees
You play his fatal game
He'll satisfy your every need
You'll never be the same

Take my hand, I'll show you how;
You've just one life to live
The road you're on goes straight to hell;
Your life is yours to give
His fantasies of all of you are much too great to see
This world your living is so unreal, perfected just for me

He'll have you down on your knees
You play his fatal game
He'll satisfy your every need
You'll never be the same

// Angel Of Death //

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in
Like cattle
You run
Stripped of
Your life's worth
Human mice, for the Angel of Death
Four hundred thousand more to die
Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood

Destroying, without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race

Surgery, with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down screaming out to die
Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher,
Angel of Death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh, drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold, cracks your limbs
How long can you last
In this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time
'Til you rip yourselves apart
Millions laid out in their
Crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve
The holocaust
Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns
Deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of
Your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain, reach out for you
His face of death staring down,
Your blood running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of
The mutants he's creating
Pathetic harmless victims
Left to die
Rancid Angel of Death
Flying free

Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher,
Angel of Death

Angel of Death

// Piece By Piece //

Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece

You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
Dismembered destiny

As soon as life has left your corpse
I'll make you part of me
No emotion
Death is all I see

Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece

Bones and blood lie on the ground
Rotten limbs lie dead
Decapitated bodies found
On my wall, your head!

On your trail I close the gap
One more life that soon won't be
No emotion
Your flesh is all I need

I'll send you to your maker
Confront the God you seek
A flash of red upon his your chest
Safety out of reach

(You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
Dismembered destiny)

(Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
There's only one way out of here
Piece by piece)

// Necrophobic //

Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged

Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair?

Ripping apart
Severing flesh
Gouging eyes
Tearing limb from limb

Experimentation, slow infection, internal decay
Execution, need transfusion, body rots away

Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine

Ripping apart
Severing flesh
Gouging eyes
Tearing limb from limb

Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged

Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair

Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine

Necrophobic can't control the paranoia
Scared to die

// Altar Of Sacrifice //

Waiting the hour destined to die
Here on the table of hell
A figure in white unknown by man
Approaching the altar of death
High priest awaiting dagger in hand
Spilling the pure virgin blood
Satan's slaughter, ceremonial death
Answer his every command

Death will come easy just close your eyes -
Dream of the friends you'll see
Heavenly failure losing again
Move on to a new form of life

Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
Confronting the evil you dread
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul
Soon you will meet the undead

(Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
Confronting the evil you dread
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul
Soon you will meet the undead)

Enter to the realm of Satan!

Blood turning black, the change has begun
Feeling the hatred of all damned in Hell
Flesh starts to burn, twist and deform
Eyes dripping blood realization of death
Transforming of five toes to two
Learn the sacred words of praise, hail Satan

A gift of powers disposed upon you
Use them when you feel the need
Master the forces and powers of Satan
Controlling the creature's instinct
Drawn to the castles that float in the sky
Learn to resist the temptation
Watching the angels sift through the heavens
Endlessly searching for salvation

// Jesus Saves //

You go to the church, you kiss the cross
You will be saved at any cost
You have your own reality
Christianity
You spend your life just kissing ass
A trait that's grown as time has passed
You think the world will end today
You praise the Lord, it's all you say

Jesus saves, listen to you pray
You think you'll see the pearly gates
When death takes you away

For all respect you cannot lust
In an invisible man you place your trust
Indirect dependency
Eternal attempt at amnesty
He will decide who lives and dies
Depopulate Satanas rise
You will be an accessory
Irreverence and blasphemy

Jesus saves, no need to pray
The gates of pearl have turned to gold
It seems you've lost your way

Jesus saves, no words of praise
No promised land to take you to
There is no other way

// Criminally Insane //

Night will come and I will follow
For my victims, no tomorrow
Make it fast, your time of sorrow
On his trail, I'll make you follow

Quarters for the criminally insane
The sentence read for life I must remain
The path I chose has led me to my grave
To try again I'd have no other way

Quarters for the criminally insane
Escape for me has fast become a game
Soon to be, I'll leave without a trace
Endangered species end the human race

Branded in pain
Marked criminally insane
Locked away and kept restrained
Disapprobation, but what have I done
I have yet only just begun
To take your fuckin' lives!

(Night will come and I will follow
For my victims, no tomorrow
Make it fast, your time of sorrow
On his trail, I'll make you follow)

// Reborn //

Convicted witch my life will end
At midnight on the stake
My dedicated life was spent
To insubordinate
Secured by lock inside a cell
Imprisoned for no crime
The shackles will be useless
When your life is out of time

Incantation spell gone by
I will see life again
My deals will made eternally
I signed the book of red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing, there is no end
I will be reborn

No gift of exile in my fate
I'll get no amnesty
You can't control my destiny
There is no habitual need
Proclaim my death, to end my wrath
It takes more than one try
Indulge your ineffective curse
I will never die

You think by killing me tonight
My powers will not rise
There'll be nowhere for you to run
When my hatred comes to life
Condemned to fill the prophecy
Allowing no first born
Defy your morbid declaration
Leave you ripped and torn

Count your blessing would be priest
As I burn upon the stake
You'd be forgiven endlessly
But your values are all fake
Forever servant of my Lord
By choice and not submission
Maybe now I've made you wonder
Am I superstition

Incantation spell gone by
I will live again
My deals will made eternally
I signed the book in red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing there is no end
I will be reborn

// Epidemic //

Breeding fast in poverty
Infectious driving dormant seed
Inside your carcass start to mate
Left in charge to dominate
Waiting to unfold
Raging uncontrolled
Adapt a potency
Death machine, infest my corpse to be

Unyielding kings of agony
Test your body chemistry
Pulmonary overthrow
Possession of your inner throne
Invasions quickly override, malicious domineering strike
Flood your veins commit slow death
Deteriorate your makers met

Perpetual demise
On a fast decline
Killing tendency
Epidemic, permanent disease

Incapacitate, fall into your fate
Pain results in screams, bleed internally
Years will pass before it can be cured

// Postmortem //

Funeral held for the depression of man
Holds the key to his own death
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck

Sifting away the debris of hated life
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind

Chanting lines of blind witchery
To save yourself from extinction
Wanting to die is your reason to live
New life born from the oppressed

Taste your blood as it trickles through the air
Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near
Fatality, reality, you await the final call

My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth
Come and die with me forever
Share insanity

Do you want to die!

The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death

// Raining Blood //

Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquittance

The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away

Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure
Now I shall reign in blood!

// Criminally Insane (Remix) //

Quarters for the criminally insane
The sentence read for life I must remain
The path I chose has led me to my grave
To try again I'd have no other way

Quarters for the criminally insane
Escape for me has fast become a game
Soon to be, I'll leave without a trace
Endangered species end the human race

Branded in pain
Marked criminally insane
Locked away and kept restrained
Disapprobation, but what have I done
I have yet only just begun
To take your fuckin' lives!

Night will come and I will follow
For my victims, no tomorrow
Make it fast, your time of sorrow
On his trail, I'll make you follow
