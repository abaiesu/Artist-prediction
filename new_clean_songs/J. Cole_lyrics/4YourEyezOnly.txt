// For Whom The Bell Tolls //

I see the, I see the..
I see the, I see the..
I see the rain pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, Lord..
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord, Lord..

The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

Bells gettin' louder, louder

I see the rain pouring down

// Immortal //

Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin', dollar and a dream with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BoFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a car time vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

Real niggas don't die
Form with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Hood niggas don't lie
Form on the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cried?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean?

Real niggas don't die
Form with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Hood niggas don't lie
Form on the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world
But while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch make it quick if the Lord take me
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas sell dope, rap or go to NBA, in that order
It's that sort of thinkin' that been keepin' niggas chained
At the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain
Listen...

// Deja Vu //

Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

And put my number in it..
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising

Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

// Ville Mentality //

How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?

Trials and tribulations
I'm facing in this age of information, I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that it faces

How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?

My dad, he died, he got shot cause his friend set him up.
And I didn't go to his funeral..and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me.
And she..and she say, clean up..I say..

Nigga play me, never
Give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never
Show my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Nigga play me, never
Give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never
Show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never

How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?

I get mad, I slam my door and go in my room..
And then, I get mad and I say, "I wish my dad was here"

// She's Mine, Pt. 1 //

I never felt so alive, I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

Catch me, don't you..
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (I don't wanna die no more)
Cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be crying baby
I'll dry your eyes, I'll dry your eyes

Every time you go to sleep you look like you in heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me
From letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself, well how about that?

She gets him, you get me
She hugs him, you kiss me
You tell me, you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him, you get me
She hugs him, you kiss me
You tell me, you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you..
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time

// Change //

My intuition is telling me they'll be better days
Yeah, my intuition is telling me they'll be better days
I like this tone..

Yeah, my intuition is telling me they'll be better days
I sit in silence and and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm in peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the father for forgiveness
God, I'm overwhelmed (Please God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if he's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, he'll never judge a man
Because he knows us all and therefore he would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother's life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..

Yeah, my chosen religion: Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt hoping to God He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I tell a nigga what to do?
I just apply this economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God; I'm going hard nigga

I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..

Yeah, prodigal son
Got a new gun, this one
Don't run out of ammo lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star, and remain my self
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt I evolve
I no longer bury demons
I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches disrespecting dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, poor...)

(I swear to God bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'mma kill them niggas man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you bro, I'mma kill them niggas bro...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'mma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is, this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse fro...

// Neighbors //

I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a racist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side

// Foldin Clothes //

I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I wanna fold clothes for you

I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I, walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I—I see a lot on your plate
9 months with that weight
I know you tired so, I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer, oh
I wanna fold clothes for you

I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I wanna fold clothes for you

Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice of being present
There's no where I need to be, except right here with you
Except right here with you
Foldin' clothes, watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows, eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl with bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day I'm drinking almond milk
You soft!

I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
That's so much better than the wrong thing
I wanna fold clothes for you

If I can make life easier, the way you do mine
Save you some time, alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax, let you recline babe
Then I should do it, cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see it's the simple things
It's the simple things, it's the simple things
Now say, "I love you", it's the simple things
It's the simple things, it's the simple things

Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Got learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say "Damn what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it dog, somehow
Peaking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright

// She's Mine, Pt. 2 //

Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, I've fallen in love
For the first time
For you I drop the tough guy shit
On this bus I sit

Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special to somebody in a world where they not lovin' me

Handcuffs keep huggin the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed and the need
To purchase shit from corporations that make a killin'
Because they feed on the wallets of the poor
Who be knockin' on they door, every Black Friday
Just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell, where's your diaper shit here
Lay on your back, don't pee right now or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing that's right in my whole life
Got me thinking...

Am I worthy of this gift
Am I strong enough to lift, into a place that I can see
Someone more important than me?
Am I worthy of this gift?
Am I strong enough to lift, into a place that I can see
Someone more important than me?
Am I worthy of this gift?

People ask me how I did this shit
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
That's the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit hey mama look what God made
She's mine
Catch me
Don't you, catch me
Don't you, catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die, cause now your here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin' baby
I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes

There is a God
It is a God
Yeah, it is a God
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you
I've fallen in love
For the first time

// 4 Your Eyez Only //

For your eyes only,
For your eyes only
For your eyes

Hey
Niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long, the consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hard headed, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall I fight regardless, screaming, "Fuck the law!", my life is lawless
That's what you call it
Ain't got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
For your eyes
Let her know my life is on it
For your eyes 
For your eyes only

For your eyes. Do you understand?
For your eyes. Do you understand? me
For your eyes. Do you understand?
For your eyes. Do you understand? me
For your eyes. Do you understand?
For your eyes. Do you understand? me
For your eyes. Do you understand?
For your eyes 

You're probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you're hearing this unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you
In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God
But because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks, I've seen far too many niggas hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, apologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance I'm a failure, addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug related
Mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet
That slow money, picked up the family business
By the age of thirteen, six years later was handed sentence
Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking, what the fuck we naming this girl?
I told her Nina, the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen
I was nineteen, took me two felonies to see the trap, this crooked ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough 'cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me, I hope you understand

For your eyes. Do you understand?
For your eyes. Do you understand? me
For your eyes. Do you understand?
For your eyes. Do you understand? me
For your eyes. Do you understand?
For your eyes. Do you understand? me
For your eyes. Do you understand?
For your eyes. Do you understand? me

It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated 'cause the cash running out
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See baby girl I realized, my definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

For your eyes
For your eyes only
For your eyes
For your eyes only
For your eyes. Do you understand?
For your eyes 

One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling
He said "Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing
When times was hard I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your mama nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects
I had to interject like, "Nigga what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I've been having premonitions, just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow, like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said the only thing I'm proud to say I was a father
Write my story down and if I pass go play it for my daughter when she ready
And so I'm leaving you this record for your eyes only, don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think this segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means I would never be brought into this world
'Cause my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesborough with
'Lil Zach and Cole World barely one years old, now it's thirty years later making sure the story's told
Girl your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving O's
Nah your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cos he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed fuck the law, although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you."
For your eyes only
