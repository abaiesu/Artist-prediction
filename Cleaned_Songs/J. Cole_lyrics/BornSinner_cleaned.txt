// Trouble //

[Hook:]
I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right
I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, God flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas say I live fast, die young, so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her but I'm thinkin' 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it, ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first the sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard Can't Get Enough
Now she fuck a nigga thinkin' that she may hit the lotto
No way Jose, could write a book called "The Things Hoes Say"
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
I'm in trouble

Gettin' to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise man
I take you to the promise land
You don't want problems, I promise man

[Hook:]
I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right
I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life

[Verse 2:]
And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off her test and I'm grabbin' her ass
She like "Don't you know this shit already? Nigga ain't you rich already?"
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hangin' 'round these rappers cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jumpshot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype, know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo sho
Had a nigga baby, little mans don't know
Momma was a freak, got it in on the low
12 years later when my song come on, he ask
"Momma did you fuck J. Cole?"
Whoa

Gettin' to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise man
I take you to the promise land
You don't want problems, I promise man

[Hook:]
I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right
I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life

// Villuminati //

[Intro:]
It's way darker this time

[Hook:]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade)

[Verse 1:]
Sometimes I brag like Hov', sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot
Homie, get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots and I don't mean no disrespect
Whenever I say faggot, okay faggot? huh, don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass
That's between you and whoever else's dick it is, pause
Maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World
I'm trying to find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hangin' out
My pop's was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say "fuck"
If the hoes like it, I love it nigga nigga nigga
Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga
Rap nerd even copped Rah Digga Digga
Pac had a nigga saying "Fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie"
I was only like eleven so forgive me
A decade later I be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it, it was "Fuck him again"
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know, in a year he'd be fucking paying me
What can you say to me, I beat the odds like Vegas
I use to rap about haters before niggas was hating me
Now they hate to see a young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me

[Hook:]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Got game back
I ain't ever letting go

[Verse 2:]
I'm prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parks where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
So I'm on the really, what could you actually tell me?
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese "Sorry"
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas "sorry"?
Never seen his pops cause he's sorry
Fuck the education, would ask for reparations
But I'm probably just gonna buy Ferraris (Vroom)
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the TV so the demons in him, I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil but now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul

[Bridge:]
My nigga
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair

I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati

[Verse 3:]
These next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati
Is you stupid nigga? Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they could do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would have been a summa cuma lade
Beyonce told me that she want to cop the new Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward (awkward),
Want to know what else is really awkward (awkward)?
When niggas buy rings for bitches that have flings
When I'm praying I don't see them at the Oscars

Re-adjusted my target audience, cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way
Like Timberlake produced by Timberland
On that goddamn Futuresex Lovesounds
What's playing in my mind? Just the sound of my whole career
Crashing burning, the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years
Until I let the Devil steer, now what have we here?
Now I got to mask my tears, but I

[Bridge:]
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again

[Outro: x2]
Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole
My nigga
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov

// Kerney Sermon (Skit) //

[Kerney Thomas:]
I'm just thankful 18 years of suffering gone just like that
You been suffering 18 years yourself
You been going through pure hell but it can be over just like that
This is pastor Kerney Thomas and I literally have tens of thousands across the country
That were hurting for God to heal them
And God could work a miracle for them
All you gotta do is either log on to our website
Or you can dial the toll-free number
And place your order right there
For the Personal Prayer Package
I want you quickly, to place that order right now
For the Personal Prayer Package
Pick up the telephone right now
I said pick up the phone right now
You're past due a miracle

// Land Of The Snakes //

[Verse 1:]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Lord, know some hoes from the past like
"Damn Cole, wish I knew that you would be rich"
Well, should've asked
It's funny how these niggas on some real "Be cool with me" shit
I bagged two bitches like it's two of me bitch
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Finally got my own bedroom in this bitch
No more sleeping in my brother's room
Like man I might as well be sleeping in my mother's room
Cause how I'm supposed to sneak hoes with my bro here?
Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all this old gear
This is flow here, this is no fair
This is so pure, this is so clear
This is one breath, this is no air
Ain't no wedding and I do the most here
I'm the President you the co-chair
You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here
Nigga I coast here
That's why they got me set up on this West Coast here
Avoiding the snakes, AK's, and coke yeah
Get my dick wet but I never let it soak there
Man I been thinkin' bout movin' out
What? Country boy in the city in New York nine years
Ran that shit like Diddy
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy

[Hook:]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes cause they watching you"
I told her, "Aw baby don't stop! I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my Sundays with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop

[Verse 2:]
Now if you only had one wish is it devious?
Cause you already know who your genie is
Can't get a cover now your mag on my penis
Like damn he turned out to be a genius
Damn real shit nigga no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes, boy, knock it off
I seen your mama in a Benz when she dropped you off
Damn now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, "What mean the world to me?"

[Hook:]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes cause they watching you"
I told her, "Aw baby don't stop! I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my Sundays with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop

[Verse 3:]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her cause see I tried to hit
On the first night, nah I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfuless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative nigga is to hit and never commit
Now realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call
She was hurting, now she staring dead in my face, she was smirking
Like, "Yeah I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga"

This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with

// Power Trip //

[J. Cole:]
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

[J. Cole:]
Okay, back when I was sleepin' in my mama's crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song "Dreams" for you
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd, Totally Krossed Out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...

[Miguel & J. Cole:]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
She got me
And we are, we are, we are
She got me

[J. Cole:]
Well this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like "Give me 20 dollars, dollars."
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...

[Miguel & J. Cole:]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
She got me
And we are, we are, we are
She got me

[J. Cole:]
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

// Mo Money (Interlude) //

Mo money, yeah
Mo money, blow money, show money
Party money, side ho money, dope money
New clothes money from shit that I wrote money
So much money I don't know who stole from me
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money
Still broke compared to niggas with old money
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money
Billionaires with Petroleum and coal money
Probably kill themselves if the had Cole money
Talk shit and I'm a see you like you owe money
I'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money
I'm overseas looking for trees to grow money
Peter Popper off robbing people for hope money
Prostitutes collecting that let me stroke money
Put up a couple dollars for the liquor store money
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money
Now the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money
When she barely on the boat got stay afloat money
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money
Spend it before we get it and could never hold money
No wallets, nah, nigga we'd rather fold money
Money control niggas, white man control money
Laughing like "yeah yeah my nigga, get your money"

// Runaway //

[Intro: Mike Epps]
Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they?
You see them with their wife, like
"What's up Tony? Hey man, how's everything going brother?"
"Just taking it easy, hanging out with the lady"
"Alright, God bless you, take it easy now"
You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, "What's up Tony?"
"Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?"

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, give me my space
Lord ain't enough time to chase all these dreams
I mean I got no time to wait
Love my girl but I told her straight up "don't wait up"
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked then made up
Used to living free as a bird, now I'm laid up
Feeling like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wanna be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowing when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wanna let her down but you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Oh shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying: "Baby, won't you throw these bands on me?"
And I came to spend, she pop a molly let the motherfucking games begin
I'm running...

[Hook:]
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on desperately
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on

[Verse 2:]
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher says we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: "Are you sure?
Even the murderer? Even the whore?
Even the nigga running through bitches on tour?"
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit
She losing faith in him and he knows and shit
Like what the fuck is a break, don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got till it ain't no more
No more tears it's been ten long years, damn near
I don't know if I can wait no more, and who can blame her
You complaining 'bout every time you out, you come back she pout
Sleeping back to back, this is wack
We 'bout to go platinum in a minute, crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of the guilt that she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home cooked meals every evening
And even then, your lowest days when you no longer Superman
At least you know you got Lois Lane
But you...

[Hook:]
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on desperately
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on

[Verse 3:]
Yeah, unbelievable seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age 3 I knew this world was three below
Listen, even know my ego low achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent, yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skate and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me:
"Jermaine, it's all pink on the inside. Fuck what color their face is."
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three fifths of them
And change empower less, brave souls reduce the cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours
Just to see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby that's not quite what you excepted
But you refuse to neglect it cause you know your wifey love you
Does you refuse to accept it?
That's that type shit that tell why my granny light skin
Rich white man rule the nation still, only difference is we all slaves now
The chains still concealed in our thoughts
If I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from 50 mill like Dave Chappell?

[Hook:]
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on desperately
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on

// She Knows //

[Background Sample:]
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly I've never had much sympathy
Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run run away, run run away, run away
Run away and never come back
Run run away, run run away, run away show 'em that your color is black

She knows, she knows
Oh I, oh I-I-I
Alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
Alright

Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch
In his ear sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

She knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want
What she want from a nigga
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
Cause I told her I was sleeping
Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
That she could be doing the same thing I suppose

She knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright

Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die

Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie

Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright

// Rich Niggaz //

I hate rich niggas god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot damn it
Who you had to kill, who you had to rob
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top damn it

Or maybe that's daddy money,
Escalator no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke 'cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga momma never had the money damn

I ain't trippin',
Nigga Jordan I ain't Pippen
Up the steps I ain't slippin'
Tears blood sweat I ain't crippin'

Here's a song you can sing along with when you down
On some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home 'cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas, you think she out there getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog now look at you

I ain't bad as that nigga,
Plus dawg I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga

Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund checks used that to float
Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac
On crack used that to cope

Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crash the boat
Could've drowned but I grabbed the rope

And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
Sing

You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna

You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna

I hate rich niggas god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot damn it
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now,
Hear my shit and try to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now,
Know you felt the shit just now

Ain't there more to you?
Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power
Fuck it, more to you

Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for more money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this ain't the same

I took a train down memory lane
And watched little Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got and now the nigga don't paint the same damn

I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane

Probably kill for another claim to fame
My brain the same, yeah nigga least he ain't insane
Least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy motherfucker you just afraid of change

That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here, I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more

Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
'Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't save your soul

But there go you, there go you, there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
Sing

You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna

You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna

How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna

// Where's Jermaine? (Skit) //

[Ken Lewis' Choir:]
For being a precious friend
I give thanks to you
For holding our spirits high
I do thank you lord
For blessing my life each day
I give thanks to you
For always being there when all is said and done (Wooo)
To thee, do we give thanks

[Ken Lewis:]
Now hol' on, hol' on, hol' up
Has anybody seen Jermaine? (No)
Jermaine
Where's Jermaine Cole?

// Forbidden Fruit //

[Hook: J. Cole]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip (boom)
Little sip
Took a little sip, took a little sip
T-t-took a little, took a little, took a little sip (uh)
Uh huh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ey yo, I walked through the valley of the shadow of death
When niggas hold tec's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check? And if so
You gotta expect to sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the old testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee "the finisher"
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run,
Try to kill me but it can't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip (boom)

[Bridge x2: Kendrick Lamar (J. Cole)]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all in my mind
All in my line like calling number nine
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-
Seven, way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
At 12, tryna get that taste of the heaven, or hell... only time will tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the double XL
Or Fader, fuck a magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'm a drop the album the same day as Kanye
Just to show the boys the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and the pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death. Blah.

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip (boom)

[Bridge x2: Kendrick Lamar (J. Cole)]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Outro: J. Cole]
Don't shit last, and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the king (and you know that)
Started with A Dollar and a Dream (and you know that)
Never give a bird bitch a ring (you should know that)
Bitch! Bitch!
That should be my new ad lib.
Bitch!
I got a new one; I finally got a cool ad lib.
Be at all the shows everybody be like
Bitch! Bitch!

[Lil Cole:]
Yo, yo, yo pull over right here, right here, here you go
Yeah pull over right here, to the right, pull over, pull over, pull over, pull over
Aight, look look, park right here, I'm a be out it'll be like 30 minutes tops
It'll be like 30 minutes, I'll be right back out, aight
Bitches come and go, bitches come and
Yo, yo what up, what's poppin', I'm back, I'm back
Yo you got that piece ready for me, that Jesus piece?
Nah the gold, the rose gold joint... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah let me see that, oh shit what is that some, what's, what the fuck is that platinum
Is that? What's that chain right there, is that's white gold, that's platinum.
Is that plat, well niggas doing platinum again, niggas doing, niggas ain't even doing platinum yet right, oh shit bout to make
Yo I'm trying to bring that shit back, kill these niggas
Let me see that one too, the wat, the watch, the platinum watch

// Chaining Day //

[Verse 1:]
Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix dream pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped the Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga, I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch yo chain, I bet it still won't free you
Cause I'll be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
So I heard my jeweler say, here go your chain my nigga

[Hook:]
This is chaining day
(I need you to love me, love me)
Chaining day, oh my chaining day
(I need you to love me, love me)
My chaining day
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair

[Verse 2:]
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Rolly
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
The same shit a rich white mo'fucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home where niggas sit today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And actin' like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated to that hundred racks, I gave it up
For what

[Hook:]
(I need you to love me, love me)
Chaining day, oh my chaining day
(I need you to love me, love me)
My chaining day
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair

[Outro:]
Lord
This is the last time
Told my accountant, it's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that shit last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
Cause I love this slavery
I need you to love me, love me, love me...
I said this is my last time

// Ain't That Some Shit (Interlude) //

OK I lied.

[Verse 1:]
Motherfucker try
Say I can't come to the hood, true lie
See I would but I'm out in Dubai
When I get back I'm a roll through that
Snatch yo bitch give yo niggas dap
The hood gone ballistic, Cole was here and you missed it
That nigga walk like Obama man
Shake yo momma's hand and kissed it
This pimp shit, pimp shit
Cole hard, you limp dick
My flow hard no wimp shit
Put in that work no temp shit
Yo bitch wearin' that lipstick
Gave this dick a french kiss
That nigga so wack when the bitch came back
Kissed her hoping that it get him sick, ha
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Ville made it to the map and shit
Niggas move cane like Kappa shit
Ain't that some shit

[Bridge:]

Bitch

Bounce (bounce) [x4]

[Verse 2:]
Flow, flow, flow, flow
Flow tight put a nigga in a headlock
Fuck hoes out of wedlock
Nigga bed rock
Red hot, so they got red dots
Pullin' that trigger nigga better be a head shot
Money long like dread locks shit
If you send shots then you bet not miss
For a couple G's, send a couple G's
Fuck copping pleas, Matlock shit (testify)
I gotta testify
Came through humble so it's best if I
Explain the noise shit, rockin' jewels shit
Got the full clip, cock and pull
Stop the bullshit watch the flow
How you gon' stop the unstoppable
Keep bitches on they toes no Dr. Scholls
It's the Roc bitch, rock and roll

[Bridge:]
I got that work
Say what? My flow

[Hook: x3]

Well paid for this rap and shit

Bitch
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce (bounce) [x4]

My nigga Syience killed this beat

// Crooked Smile //

[TLC:]
Even though I...

[Chorus 1 — TLC:]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back 'round

[J. Cole:]
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you're a woman, I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels; I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on, stare in the mirror
But it's clear that you can't face what's wrong; no need to fix
What God already put his paint brush on; your roommate yelling
"Why you gotta take so long?" What it's like to have a crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Chorus 1]

[J. Cole:]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be, and that's you
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while, but I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2 — J. Cole (TLC):]
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em
(You're the one that was tryna keep me way down)
(But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back round...)

[J. Cole:]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation
Or in jail; wonder why we inhale
Cause we in hell already - I ask if my skin pale
Would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil'
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail
I got money for the bail now, well now
If you asking will I tell now? Hey, hell naw - I ain't snitching cause
Man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro — Choir:]
Ohhhhhhhhhhohoh [4x]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la [4x]
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, all you know I found my way back 'round, baby, back 'round...
You are the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, I know you I found my way back 'round, back 'round...
You are the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back 'round

// Let Nas Down //

Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I used to print out Nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though 'cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, "You the one, yo, why you make that shit?"

I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made "You Owe Me"
Dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the hits?" You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label - are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game

But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
I'm a shame, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open up doors
Reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars, and so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?

Letting Nas down, I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

// Born Sinner //

[Verse 1:]
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath, I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship Lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Now you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking their lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that the college point is right to
"Be All That You Can Be" posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'd find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind this, singing...

[Hook — James Fauntleroy:]
I'm a born sinner, but I'll die better than that; swear.
You were always where I needed you to be whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning but I live better than that (better than that, better than that)
And if you ain't fucking with that, I don't care.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2 — J. Cole:]
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
I got a life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you, you the only reason why I don't flip and go insane
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows them
Don't you ever go expose them
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's a tutor for me
Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

[Hook — James Fauntleroy 2x:]
I'm a born sinner, but I'll die better than that; swear.
You were always where I needed you to be whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning but I live better than that (better than that, better than that)
And if you ain't fucking with that, I don't care.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

// Miss America //

This is a public service announcement!
Brought to you by the good people at Dreamville Records
And so my fellow americans
Ask not what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country

Excuse me...

Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get oscars
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg
Don't trip nigga, they just words
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel
I'll, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas

Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell 'em, bitch
If you ain't fuck with me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'm a pass your classes, I'm a learn your craft
I'm a fuck your daughters, I'm a burn your flag

Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell 'em, bitch
If you ain't fuck with me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

They don't feel my pain
They'll never feel my pain
And they'll never play this shit on the radio

// New York Times //

But this shit really for Queens though
Really for Queens though, ya know?
Big city of dreams, motivated by schemes
Getting money regiment with my get money regime
Nah mean? yeah

New York times, come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money, it seems, by any means
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter
Up here, life is a bitch, I blow a kiss at her daughter
In the city where niggas will leave you shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once
My nigga visibly stressing, a mess, he smoking his blunt
What could I say, I can't relate to that, all I do is pray for that
This the city of God told me "Go and make it" at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that

[J. Cole:]
Hop on the F train, took the express train
Skip that local shit, my vocals sick, that's how success came
Once kings now we pawns in this chess game
Wall street got black slave blood stains
Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparations for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise
Imagine the world, free from pain
And we no longer scared at night
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind
We don't make it primetime till we dyin'

Till eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake
Should've been in the States, property of the Jakes
Now I'm plotting on profits and properties on the lake
Let me properly integrate you to it
Show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen
Cities you never heard of, from the streets where they murder
Police observe us till they reach the verdict
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all
If you can't send 'em to the pen, send 'em to the morgue
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad

[Verse 1:]
Art of seduction
Hoes jump like vince carter backstage like they apart of production
We talked about her dreams you gotta start out with somethin'
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustlin'
Found it funny cause now they daughter is stuck-in
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga
Well, movin on
Funny cause I only know a couple of your songs
But I love when they come on
Word?

I'll take it, Baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot you not wasted, look in the blocks with mindplay [?]
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick
Girl, How could you not taste it?

[Verse 2:]
That's a little egotistic, my amigos be hocking in Toledo
Niggas winning off me, it's all G though,
Cause he know bitches can't get the Michael so they settling for Tito
We know, yeah nigga we know, hot bitch fell in my lap like cappucino
Niggas so thirsty it irks me, you keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though,
Nah nigga, the game is to get, a bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit,
I swear if niggas put half of what they put in chasing ass into a craft, now you'd be famous and rich,
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch, while you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick,
She thinking she got a first round pick, she thinking bout all the things she can get,
She thinking you got a Range for a whip, and a fly ass cribbo, and it's not that simple cause,
All you got is a phone full of bitches, and they just like her
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word, wanna ride my nouns, let her suck my verbs... Aye

[Bridge:]
I'll take it, Baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot you not wasted, look in the blocks with mindplay [?]
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick
Girl, How could you not taste it?

// Niggaz Know //

These niggas know

[Verse 1:]
Armed and dangerous, call the law
Stick to the script, no audible
Country ass nigga with an Audemars
Can't spell the shit but I order more
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle
Get good head on the Autobahn
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was 9-7
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'
You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game would do to you
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Better me than you

[Bridge:]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came on home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Hook:]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know

[Verse 2:]
These niggas know, boo-ya nigga?
Came through the door like who y'all niggas?
Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggas
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggas
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggas but
Don't let the college shit fool y'all niggas
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggas
Like what's the problem?
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan
My shit long, need a hair salon
Get it cut, shut the fuck up
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)
What the fuck was I s'posed do?
Deny that, rather try that, but I never fly that,
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpackin', that's hip hop
Write my life and make sure that the script hot
And pray the kids watch, if not
These niggas know
If not, these niggas know

[Bridge: x2]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came on home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Hook:]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know

// Sparks Will Fly //

[Jhene Aiko (J. Cole):]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close
In time,
Sparks will fly
(And we fly too, and we, and we, and we fly too)

[Jhene Aiko (J. Cole):]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out,
We're tired
We only need to stay close
In time
Sparks will fly
(And we fly too, and we, and we, and we fly too)

Baby you deserve the whole enchilada,
Gucci and Prada
Toast to the days when I didn't have a dollar
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me

Down for me, my homie
You better believe
I know your home girl said you should leave
Know you as tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?

Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album, probably pass this on
Thought they knew me, well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell

The happiness can't buy yo ass this new SL
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit
Ride and die chick fighting insecurities
Want a ring and my last name for securities

[Jhene Aiko (J. Cole):]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out,
We're tired
We only need to stay close
In time,
Sparks will fly
(And we fly too, and we, and we, and we fly too)

(And we fly too, and we, and we, and we fly too)

I know my style ain't perfect
I know my smile ain't perfect
Nigga ain't perfect, it's true
Funny though I'm perfect for you

All the drama seem worth it for you
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true
Now what you crying for?
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for, lyin' for?

She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war
End up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back

I say those words hoping that
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And though I slip, only girl in my life is you

[Jhene Aiko (J. Cole):]
It may seem like our fire

[Jhene Aiko:]
Feels as though our world's crashing down
We can't forget to breathe through this now
We live through the ups and the downs
It'll get better

[Jhene Aiko:]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out
We're tired
We only need to stay close
In time
Sparks will fly
