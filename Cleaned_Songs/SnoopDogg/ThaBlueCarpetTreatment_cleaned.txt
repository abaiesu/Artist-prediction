// Intrology //

[George Clinton]

As I take another choken toke of icky sticky stanky

Stuff a bull, pack a pipe, twist a blunt, roll and light a joint

Lean back and puff slow [echoes]

[Snoop Dogg]

Whenever I'm making a record, I'm getting into my character

And I'm trying to to portray something that I'm feeling so that way the whole world can believe in it


Do anybody know my name!?
[crowd cheers]


What's my name!?

(Snoop Dogg!)

What's my name!?

(Snoop Dogg!)

Hold on, I want y'all to say my name like dis..


(Snoop, Snoop, Snoop, Snooooop)


There are seven wonders in the world, you're about to witness the eighth

[Jay-Z sample:] Nigga ask about me, nigga ask about me!


You don't believe me? Motherfucker say what!?

Aiyyo Cat, roll out the blue carpet cause

Lemme C-walk on these niggas


Blue hat, blue socks, blue shoes, too cool

Blue car, blue house, blue pit, blue pool

Blue grass, blue Coupe, blue b-ball hoop

What kind of phone you on Loc? I'm on the Bluetooth

Talking to my nephew, my nigga Boo, half who?

He make pimping on a bitch look so cool

Old school, old fools, steel on a nigga first

Run up with that punk shit and I fill up a nigga's shirt

Do it to it hurt 'cause it hurt so bad (so bad!)

Snoopy D O dub they can't touch yo' swag (yo' swag!)

Oh mark ass nigga better tuck yo' flag

'Cause when my music out loco, I come to smash yo' ass

Fuck him, fuck her, and fuck all y'all too

(He wants everything to be right) 'Cause I'm... (Snoop Dogg!)

I'm so hood, so true

and every time that you see me cause, I'm oh so blue!

(To get that you have to stay.. on top of your game)

(And learn the most specific lesson...)

That shit is dope right there God...

// Think About It //

Yeah man...


"You know it's easy to talk about.. doin somethin

but when it comes down to the action part, the most folks take a little

light vacation"

[Snoop Dogg]

Mmmm.. I was just thinkin to myself man

Y'know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me

And I need to let my peoples know how deep it is to me

On some real talk like...


It's like lookin and poppin and seein whoppers and movers

Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low

Nobody's guidance so I decided to sleep by the do'

Open my mind try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'

Driftin off into another stage of life

Nigga paid ya price and big homies made ya fight

Niggaz ain't wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no

Toe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo'

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]

Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind

Many men were eradicated by music minds

Open ya eyes and take ya time to visualize

And once ya decide to move ya mind in due time

It's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin naughty

Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move ya body

It's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest

You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it

[Snoop Dogg]

Fuck that nigga, I'ma do it right

Thangs ain't movin right, I don't think that you would like

for me to be mad, saying, "Niggaz can't stand me"

Sittin at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy's

Wishin I was there, naw nigga I don't wish no more

I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl

Basically you hear these rappers out here using my flow

They need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though

In dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI

Takin my time, chronolizing my rhyme

Writing my rhyme, tryin to get intellectual

Directing the weather, makin my negative records more intellectual

Tryin to change the direction of flowin

And sayin, born sayin, "You know I get live-er when I get fluent"


Ain't been nobody to change game since King came

Same thing, same lane, hit it and ya get banged

Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope

Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable

And they don't know how to do it 'cause they don't flow that way

Go that way, roll that Jay

Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony

You're so into what ya doin but you can't get into it

You can't talk and now ya ruined but y'know I'ma do it

And now you doin it, they booing like, "You blew it! You blew it!"

I'm dippin through the universe, make 'em move the verse

Through the Luda-verse, hit the boota first

You can never beat a hoe, lemme show you how to treat a hoe

If you likin me, follow me, you so believable

(So...) Got a way to get his own music out

Record executive, bounce ballin and actin bad

Take my time, with my.. great mind

Take 'em out, make mine, kicked about it

Thanks to niggaz who might make it illegal

And not rival the Beatles, and rock, rockin my peoples

And fly, fly like eagles been doin the shit like liters

And hittin y'all with heaters and walkin in my Adida's

I continue to bust, then I switched up to chucks

Givin niggaz a puff, still givin it up

Beanie Sigel what up? Real niggaz is up

On the scheme with my team, yeah Daz and Kurupt

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]

We bust 'til we buss 'em up

(Lay Low), I know they told you not to fuck with us

Layin and playin, and sayin man, walkin in vain

Anxious for fame, my nigga tryin to walk in my lane

And tryin to.. walk in my shoes but they just don't fit

You couldn't spit the shit that I spit 'cause I'm the shit

And this is it, legit, let's split the chips

And fix, and move the work and hurt that bitch

I'm through with this! [crowd cheers]

// Crazy //

[gun shots]

"Black folks can't never have no fun!"

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]

These streets beeeee walking down the avenue

(Crazy!) From Hollywood to South Central!

These streets beeeee.. crazy!

Long Beach to Comptoooon!

Always up to no good! Craaaaaaaa

(Crazy!) Crazy..

Always up to no good!

Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy

(Crazy!)

[Snoop Dogg]

Have a look outside and take a stroll with me

California lifestyle, you wanna roll with me?

I can take you in and out and where it's gonna be

Now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me

I wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong of me

I'ma stay down, you see me on them corners G

At your local liquor store, getting some optimums

And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'

Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast

Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost

A-humph.. yeah, I love my folks

But half of y'all fools is cutthroats

On the real no.. the streets'll have you

Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile

Yeah, see you gradually grow

and when you walking on my side I think you all need to know...

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]

On the 110 Freeway flo', back to the block

In the seven deuce Coupe, hopping hipping the hop

Sipping on some Henn with my nephew Infrared

Young pimp on the grind tryna line up some head

Had fun, did, done, on the West we run

Don't matter where you from, if you old or young

Seesaw we raw like ooohhh-la-la

Fuck the law we don't get caught we just do-da-da

Yeah nigga we shaking the cops

You niggas out there just be making it hot

But don't trip if you faking a lot

I'll break you, shake you, and take yo' spot
[singing] Because if you think that you gonna slip through California

without getting banged on.. brother you're wrong

[Break: Nate Dogg]

(Always up to no good!) I really love my dog, grew up together and all but he

(Always up to no good!) Hell yeah I love New York

that's why I married the broad but she

(Always up to no good!) We can't hang 'em up 'cause I'm a balla y'all and he

(Always up to no good!) Let me tell you about these streeeets

(Always up to no good!)

[Chorus w/ the phrase "Always up to no good!" at the beginning of each line]

// Vato //

Man, don't you know that I'm loco?

I was chilling right around my way
21st Eastside at the beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talking shit with his homies
Like he was a straight G!

Asking where I'm from while he running up
Gangbang my set on everyone of them
(20s nigga)
Some things, sons they just won't change
Fools don't respect nothing but the gangbang

What's seen is what's sawn
Dogg is the law
I have you niggas running like a marathon
Lil G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talking 'bout they gon' get my chain, and they gon' leave with it

But they don't know
Once they get close
It's tic tac toe
Three motherfuckers laid on the floor
(Watch out)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray
I heard an ese say
He said

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."
(Ah huh)
They keep fucking, and it went too far
So Snoopy—he went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun, and they start running hard
He started firing and then he just charged

Blaow!
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

Blaow
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's 3 motherfuckers dead, and I ain't seen shit
But these niggas 'a scream with plea
But for a G like me it's just a case
Really you could see

I crack the Mac back
And pop off rolling
And smack your neck back
You drop off falling
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me

Fuck that. I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl
You would think that they were brawlers
Believing all the things that you never saw
In it y'all? Been a Dogg
Smoke you like a menthol

You think you know?
But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my dough?
What the fuck? No

See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed
All you'll hear my enemies going

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."
(Ah huh)
They keep fucking, and it went too far
So Snoopy—he went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun, and they start running hard
He started firing and then he just charged

Blaow!
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

Blaow
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth
God damn
And Snoop 'a keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets
Run with them niggas with the heat

You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be beast of the East, motherfucker

I never hesitate to blaze
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team 'cause my peoples
Are screaming that we need more
For fun or is it legal

Put the bang on this song
Make it feel like a drive-by
It's a shame but somebody gotta die
They say it happens state to state
But when I mobbing LA
All I hear the eses say
They go

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."
(Ah huh)
They keep fucking, and it went too far
So Snoopy—he went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun, and they start running hard
He started firing and then he just charged

Blaow!
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

[Snoop Dogg]

Let's get this party jumpin'

Me and Kel gone get it bumpin'

Like when it's over

We gone all get into somethin'

The Dog is fresh

Southside without a vest

Nothin on my chest

But these ladies up out the Midwest

I must confess

That in the Chi is so blessed

Leaving nothing on my mind

But Doggy, you and safe sex

This ain't a test

You fucking with a cold mess

Meet me in Chicago

Let me get you to this real west

It's real strong

Real fat and real long

Doggies in the building

Holdin' something they can feel up on

And once they get it

Something they can build up on

Take that skinny nigga home

Work that filling till it's gone

Get that home grown

Put that shit on Daddy long

I know how you ladies do it

T-shirt with no panties on

Let's get this shit crackin'

Kell and Doggy Dogg in action

If you in here all alone

You might get this dog bone

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]

I pull up, whip low in the Phantom

With the wheels spinnin'

Cuz they know what we in here for

Dogg and Kelly came to ball

Get your ass up off the wall

Let that middle wiggle

Now make that shit fall

Not just one, but all y'all

Move it like you want it all

Let me see you bounce it for me

Work that shit for Doggy Dogg

You gots to do it

Is that your crew

Bring 'em too

Come here let me take you through it

Then once Kelly get into it

We can get this after party

Poppin' everybody

Got themselves another body

Knockin' out

Without protection though

That's my confession

But at the spot

If you just think

Your gonna listen

You can drop it like it's hot

Hold up

I came to cool out

Lay back and get blown

Maybe Henny, maybe gin

A couple shots of Patron

And if you didn't you missed it

But now it's known

That this cash shit

Kells sing that song

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]

I pull up, whip low in the Phantom

and every real B-Dogg, to the table right now

Yeah... we gon' push a real line right now

See if y'all with this real gangsta guerrilla shit


Have you ever seen 100,000 Rip riders from the side

Blue Chuck's, blue rags, grey clouds, blue skies

On the move, can't lose, Hill Street blues

Niggaz gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray

these suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news

She shook up, look up and then she put me on the move

I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far

Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park

And I got into a squab, got caught and went to jail

Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail

4800 with this Crippin', oh well

My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail

He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right

Eyes open 'cause niggaz get stuck on seez-ight

It ain't no motherfuckin' problem - pop-pop, tick-tock

Never flip-flop, 20 Crippin' til I drop

[Chorus]

Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip

So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot

Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip

So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot

Ca-rip

[The Game]

Is I, in the motherfuckin' S-5

With the red bandana double knotted 'round the rearview

Niggaz see clear through, they know that it's Game

Cherry red Lowenhart's let 'em know that I bang

So bang, like Snoop in "Deep Cover"

I got the seat reclined, fo-five under the white-T, smothered

Dippin' down Green Leaf, I ain't got no enemies

Been shot five times, now I bleed Hennessy

And bang for my niggaz locked up, they can't stop us

It ain't a gangsta party 'til we go and dig Pac up

I'm Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on

Hughey P. Lewis with Air Force One's on

I gangbang but I'm the opposite of Tookie Williams

Red Lambo', red bandana print ceilin'

Me and Snoop got the West Coast locked

Red and blue rag tied in a knot

With all my motherfuckin' homies yellin' out

[Chorus]

So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot

Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip

So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot

Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip

[The Game]

I ran outta gas in Long Beach, I'm stuck

Ain't no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck's

Hopped out the '6-trey, nowhere to go

Til' Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steeler '6-4

We "Just Dippin", one Bloodin' one Crippin'

I'm on that Bulls shit, throwback Scott' Pippen

Moral is, my bandana hangin' from the left side

So if you ain't a Crip or a Blood, just throw up Westside

[Snoop Dogg]

(What up Blood?) Yeah cuz, we just tippin'

Me and Game doin' thangs, switchin' lanes, Hurricanes on my feet

Stop, and C-Walk to the beat

Game, take the wheel and turn on 21st Street

Eastside LBC, gun in my hand

It's the turf by the surf but we don't play in the sand

We just - slip and slide out, we Rip and ride out

Let it C known, nigga welcome to the Thunderdome

[Chorus]

Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip

So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot

Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip

So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot

So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot

Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip...
