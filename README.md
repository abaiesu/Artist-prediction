# Artist prediction
CSE204 project 2023 

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model which matches the lyrics of a song to a predicted artist. \
One of the motivations behind the project is to detect ghostwriters writing lyrics for multiple artists. \
Our dataset is made out of 24829 songs for 220 artists. More information can be found in the notebook DataPreprocessing.ipynb. We used a webscrapper. More information can be found in the scraper folder.\
The performance of our model can be checked at the end of the notebook LogReg.ipynb\
The slides of the presentation are joined in the repository and provide a detailed overview of the project.

USAGE:
Run DataPreprocessing.ipynb. This will generate .pkl files too heavy to be present in the repository. Then run LogReg.ipynb.
