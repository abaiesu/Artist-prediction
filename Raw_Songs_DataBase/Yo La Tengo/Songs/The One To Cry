I told you if I ever caught you fooling round again
That if you were untrue
That you and I are through
But now I've caught you and I know that this should be the end

Though I should tell you so
My heart keeps saying no
Oh if I say goodbye then I am gonna be the one to cry

Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry

Oh I can't bare to be the one to keep you from my side
How could you be so cruel 
You played me for a fool
But if I change my mind then I would throw away my pride

So now what should I do
Oh how I wish I knew
Oh if I say goodbye then I am gonna be the one to cry

Cry cry cry cry 
Cry cry cry cry

So now what should I do 
Oh how I wish I knew
Oh if I say goodbye then I am gonna be the one to cry

Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
