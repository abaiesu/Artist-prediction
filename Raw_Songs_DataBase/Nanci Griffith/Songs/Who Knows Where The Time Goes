Across the evening sky
All the birds are leaving
But how can they know
It's time for them to go
Before the winter fire
I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time
For who knows where the time goes
Who knows where the time goes

Sad deserted shore
Your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know
It's time for them to go
I will still be here
I have not thought of leaving
I have no thought of time
For who knows where the time goes
Who knows where the time goes

And I am not alone
While my love is near me
I know it will be so
Until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter
And then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time
For who knows how my love grows
And who knows where the time goes
