Your phone call took my by surprise
Gee, it's been a long, long time
Since those hot and humid Texas nights
When we went swimm'n in the tide

Corpus Christi seems so far away
And I'm not talk'n 'bout the miles
And there ain't much I wouldn't give today
Just to see one of your smiles

But here I sit alone in Denver
Sipp'n the California wine
And I've got all night to remember you
I'm in a lone star state of mind

I just saw John Wayne on the Late, Late Show
Save the girl and ride away
And I was hoping as the credits rolled
He'd make it back to her someday

But here I sit alone in Denver
Sipp'n the California wine
And I've got all night to remember you
I'm in a lone star state of mind

It's a thousand miles or more
From here to your front door
I'd be there tomorrow if I left today
And I'd just pack up my guitar
You know it's really not that far
When you called you said I'd have a place to stay

But here I sit alone in Denver
Sipp'n the California wine
And I've got all night to remember you
I'm in a lone star state of mind
