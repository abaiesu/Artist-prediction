I want tomorrow today
I didn't think that I'd
Have yesterdays all week on someone else's time

Yeah, I like that car
Suppose the colour's OK
Fibre glass and rust are filling in my day

I want to see the sunrise in the night time
I'm gonna fake... an alibi

Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)

Repossess my heart
I gave it away
A loan is all
But nothing lasts forever these days

Got a stereo, 100 watts a side
Its matt black face is laughing at my life

I wanna see the starlight, in the day time
I'm gonna fake... an alibi

Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)

I want to see the sunrise in the night time
I'm gonna fake... an alibi

Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
