I'll miss you singing Stevie Wonder
Isn't she lovely till 3 a.m.
When you'd always look into my eyes
I never wanna say goodbye
Sitting and waiting for it to happen again

But for every time I saw you block my call
I wish I'd never been with you at all

You got your sold-out shows, your perfect hair
But when it comes to me, baby, did you ever care?
I've never met nobody who talks about themselves so strong
So strong 

You got your big red car, your fancy clothes
How I ever fell for you, I'll never really know
Two months never felt so long
Long, so long

I'll miss the trips to New York City
Listening to you from back stage
After all these hours pass me by
You just need some time with the guys, what about me?

Every time you say I waste your time
I wish you and I could go and press rewind

You got your sold-out shows, your perfect hair
But when it comes to me, baby, did you ever care?
I've never met nobody who talks about themselves so strong
So strong

You got your big red car, your fancy clothes
How I ever fell for you, I'll never really know
Two months never felt so long
Long, so long

You got your big red car, your fancy clothes
How I ever felt for you, I'll never really know
Two months never felt so long
