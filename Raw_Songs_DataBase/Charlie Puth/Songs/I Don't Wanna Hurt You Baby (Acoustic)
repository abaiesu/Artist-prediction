Ohh
Yeah

I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
I see you walkin' over there with all your friends
Eyein' me down but remember what you said to me
We've been on and off for a couple months now
Feelin' ok about it all but baby somehow
You keep coming back to me
The last thing I wanna do is leave again
And end up bringin' you down
And you can't just come around
I don't wanna keep playin' these games
I've broken your heart and caused you so much pain
All I've gotta say is

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on, yeah
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

Girl, even though you do it better than anyone else
Staying with me ain't no good for your health
That way I don't have to explain why
For all it's worth at least we gave it a try
Please believe in me cause
The last thing I wanna do is leave again
And end up bringin' you down
Cause you can't just come around
I don't wanna keep playin' these games
I've broken your heart and caused you so much pain
And all I've gotta say is

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more, yeah

Remember when I told you
"That I'll love til day is done
You're the one that makes me happy"
God, what have I done?

Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on, yeah
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
I don't wanna hurt you baby, baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

Yeah, baby, I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
I don't wanna hurt you like I did before
