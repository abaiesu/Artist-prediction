Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

Why you always lookin' at your phone?
Watchin' people you don't even know
I can lay here by myself alone
Self alone, yeah
I don't want us to be enemies
So I'm thinkin' maybe I should leave
'Cause you bringin' out the worst in me
Worst in me, yeah

I love you so much that I hate you
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
So damn beautiful

Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

Every time that you say you're gonna leave
That's when you get the very best of me
You know we need it like the air we breathe
Air we breathe, yeah

I love you so much that I hate you (Oh)
Right now, it's so hard to blame you (Oh)
'Cause you're so damn beautiful (Oh)
You're so damn beautiful (Oh)

Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh (I don't wanna know)
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

The hardest part of all (Da-da-da-dum-da-da)
Is that we're only built to fall (Is it easier?)

Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh (Oh)
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same (Is it easier?)
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go? (Yeah)
I don't wanna know, oh (Oh)
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

I love you so much that I hate you (Hate you)
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
