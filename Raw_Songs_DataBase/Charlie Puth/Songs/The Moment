There's a moment when you find out
Who your true friends are
The ones who don't go by everyone elses ways

And its important to realize who your
One and true love is
And to not look back on yesterday's

Don't be asking what this world needs now
You need to ask what makes you come alive some how
Cause you do you better than anyone here
So mark this as your year

Tomorrow I'm going on that train
And I'm gonna pretend that it doesn't stop
Cause I'm taking all my fears an making them my destination
Bottom all the way to the top
Don't be asking what this world needs now
I need to see what makes me come alive some how
Cause I do me better than anyone here
So mark this as my year

Don't be asking what this world needs now
You need to ask what makes you come alive somehow
Cause I do me better than anyone here this is my year
I have no fear cause all my obstacle's are clear
