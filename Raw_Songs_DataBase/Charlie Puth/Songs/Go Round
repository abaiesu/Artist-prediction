I gotta have you now, it's not an option.
You're taking off your blouse and I'm watching.
In front of your mirror, I turn the curtain down.
I couldn't be any clearer what we're gonna do now.

I wanna see you riding and grinding and
We're gonna get it right we're colliding we're
Gonna have to keep quiet, trying to keep it down.
You're taking off my shirt, for another go round.
For another go round.
For another go round.

I gotta have you now, just can't take it.
I wanna put you down when we're faded.
At the top of your lungs, you'll be screaming my name.
And we've gone too far to call it all the way.

I'll pick you up and lay you on the kitchen counter.
Say you couldn't do without it, I'm okay if you're about it.
Down on every direction, got me hypnotized.
I'm hallucinating, going out of my mind.
For another go round
For another go round

It's like every other evening let me see what you can do.
Yeah, ohohoh I got all this paper, let me throw it all on you.
For another go round.
For another go round.
