Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible said and it still is news

Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade

Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding round your door
When you're gone, and spending ends
They don't come no more

Rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much

Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own
