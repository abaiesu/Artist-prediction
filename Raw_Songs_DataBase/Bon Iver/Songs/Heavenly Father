Ever since I heard the howling wind
I didn't need to go where a bible went
But then you know your gifts seemed heaven-sent
Just lead me to a choler, dad, that's the thing

And I don't know how you house the sin
(But you're free now)
I was never sure how much of you I could let in
(And I'm free now)
Won't you settle down, baby, here your love has been
Heavenly father, it's definitely lava
Why you don't carry other names?

Heard about a day where it dropped the know
To go another day as we learn to close
'Cause I'm a known coward in a coward wind
(But you're free now)
You turn around now and you count to ten
(To see you go now)
Well, I know now, honey, that I can't pretend
Heavenly father, is who's brought to his autumn
And love is left in the end

'Cause I've just been up here for goddamn years
(Can you see now?)
Filling up hulls with goddamn fears
(I am free now)
I know about it darling, I've been standing here
Heavenly father, is all that he offers
A safety in the end
