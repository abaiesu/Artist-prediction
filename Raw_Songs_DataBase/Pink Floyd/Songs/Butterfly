Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out

Sometime when I watch you
I stretch out my hand to touch you
'Cause it drive me wild
To see you flutter by
You butterfly

I won't squeeze you dead
Aiming through your head
I just want your love

I won't write your name
In Latin in a frame
'Cause framing is a chain

Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out
