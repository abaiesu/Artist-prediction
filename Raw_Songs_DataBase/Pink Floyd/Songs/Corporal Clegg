Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war, in 1944

Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red and blue
He found it in the zoo

Dear oh dear, oh were they really sad for me?
Dear oh dear, oh will they really laugh at me?

Missus Clegg, you must be proud of him
Missus Clegg, another drop of gin?

Corporal Clegg, umbrella in the rain
He's never been the same
No one is to blame

Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream
From Her Majesty the Queen
His boots were very clean

Missus Clegg, you must be proud of him
Missus Clegg, another drop of gin?


Corporal Clegg
