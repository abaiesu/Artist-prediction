Emily tries, but misunderstands (Ah-ooh)
She's often inclined to borrow
Somebody's dreams till tomorrow

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Soon after dark, Emily cries (Ah-ooh)
Gazing through trees in sorrow
Hardly a sound till tomorrow

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Put on a gown
That touches the ground (Ah-ooh)
Float on a river
Forever and ever, Emily (Emily)

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
