Everything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancing in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right?

My, my, apple of my eye
Looking really hot while I make ya cherry pie
Show me what you got, got a sparkle in your eye
You're so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holding me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight

My, my, looking really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I'm so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have my one true love tonight
Will you be mine?
Oh hi, looking kinda shy
Cause the way you put your hands on me
Well I, I can barely breathe
Baby boy you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
Baby don't be scared, come on honey, smile
Everything is fine now, everything is fine

My, my, talking all night
Laughing really hard and it makes me wanna cry
I love our playing house, love our dressing-up nights
Drinks on ice

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you, I want you
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
I caught you, I caught you

I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you
I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you
