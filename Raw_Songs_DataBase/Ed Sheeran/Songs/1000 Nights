I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on
Puttin' up fifty thousand lights
I've been gone so long, getting up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights

This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch, look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touch down
Everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose
I be like, "What now?"
I started making moves
They showing me love now
Lit like a light bulb, 'cause bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda pop and
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold the rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now I walk in the stadium, tell 'em, play my shit
And they gon' sing it like this

Well, I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on
Puttin' up fifty thousand lights
I've been gone so long, getting up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights

Last night I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but what does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember damn, me and my man inside of a Sprinter van
Two hundred a night until 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was out there couchin' with friends
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
Two pound pint, the waitress made me leave my number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo!)
And I don't think it's gonna be stopping any time soon
Birds eye view, paid my dues for a two mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Let me invite you to my world

I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on
Puttin' up fifty thousand lights
I've been gone so long, getting up and gettin' faded (Gettin' faded)
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights

I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up just like the reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make it seem often
Saint Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green on fleek
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran, just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe you know she be flee, ah yeah
Everyday I be seein' her in Celine, ah yeah
She wanna come closer but I don't see her still
I'm not a regular person, I be low key, ah yeah

From New York out to London, she was, she was with me all the time
And I been on the road so long, she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes

Well, I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day
Playin' on, playin' on
Puttin' up fifty thousand lights
I've been gone so long, getting up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights
