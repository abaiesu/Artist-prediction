If I had counted one two three before I made you cry
If I had counted four and five and made another try
If we had counted six seven eight and made a brand new start
If we had counted nine and ten we wouldn't be apart

One, two, three, come back to me and let bygones go by
Four and five, I know that I've been a foolish guy
Six, seven, eight, give me a date and I'll be as good as pie
Nine and ten, kiss me again, who wants to say goodbye

If I had counted one two three before I walked away
If I had counted four and five well I'd whispered darling stay
If we had counted six seven eight and turned on all our charms
If we had counted nine and ten we'd be in each other's arms

One, two, three, come back to me and let bygones go by
Four and five, I know that I've been a foolish guy
Six, seven, eight, give me a date and I'll be as good as pie
Nine and ten, kiss me again, who wants to say goodbye

One to ten, kiss me again, who wants to say goodbye
