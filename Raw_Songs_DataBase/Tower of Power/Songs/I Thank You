You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you

Then you took your love to someone else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death
You made me feel like I've never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to hold it but you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you

Every day was something new
You pull out your bag and you're fine to do
You got me trying new things too
Just so I can keep up with you

You didn't have to shake me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did, yes you did and I thank you

All my life I've been shortchanged
Without your love baby, it's a crying shame
And now I know what the fellas are talking about
When they say that they been turned out

I want to thank you, I want to thank you
I want to thank you, thank you, baby

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to hold me like you did
But you did, yes you did and I thank you

I thank you, thank you, baby
I thank you, baby, I gotta thank you
