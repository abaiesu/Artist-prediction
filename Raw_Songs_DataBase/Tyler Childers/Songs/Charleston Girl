Charleston girl in a darkened room
And you don't know her like I do
We took the fire escape to her room
And got stone-raging blind

Left my money in the trusting hands
Of them old Steel Brothers in a 'fastgrass' band
One day I'm gonna drive up there
And give them half my mind

I don't know if it's the wine or the coke
That makes her sound like her jaw is broke
She's working hard to make some sense
But she ain't got a dime

I wish to God that I could help her out
I wish I knew what she was talkin' bout
I wish to God that I could get away
But I'm way too drunk to drive

All I know is that when I am good and sober
I am leavin' West Virginia for a while
Don't know why, but every time I cross that river, Lord
There's somethin' tears me up and makes me wild

Charleston girl with raven hair
Bloodshot eyes and skin so fair
I believe if I could find my keys
I'd try to drive away

I never planned to leave so soon
I didn't know that he was sweet on you
Go ahead and take her
Cause she ain't worth the time

All I know is that when I am good and sober
I am leavin' West Virginia for a while
Don't know why but every time I cross that river
Lord, there's somethin' tears me up, makes me wild
