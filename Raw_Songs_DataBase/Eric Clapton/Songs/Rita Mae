Rita Mae, Rita Mae
Come and visit me today
Rita Mae, Rita Mae
Come and visit me today
I'll do anything you want
Give you anything you say

I saw you out walking
With your other man today
I saw you out walking
With your other man today
If I catch you one more time
I'm gonna blow you both away

Rita Mae, Rita Mae
I'll see you one more time today
Rita Mae, Rita Mae
I'll see you one more time today
When I've finished what I've done
Gonna come and drive you away
