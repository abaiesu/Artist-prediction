Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Well, if I've done somebody wrong, Lord
Have mercy, if you please

I used to have plenty of money
The finest clothes in town
But bad luck and trouble overtaken me
Bound to get me down

Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Well, if I've done somebody wrong, Lord
Have mercy, if you please

Keep on working now, child
Lord, every morning

Well, if I've been a bad boy, baby
I declare I'll change my ways
I don't want bad luck and trouble
To follow me all my days

Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Well, if I've done somebody wrong, Lord
Have mercy, if you please
