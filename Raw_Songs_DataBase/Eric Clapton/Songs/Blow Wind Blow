When the sun rose this morning
I didn't have my baby by my side
When the sun rose this morning
I didn't have my baby by my side
I don't know where she was
I know she's out with some another guy

Don't the sun look lonesome
Shading down behind the trees?
Don't the sun look lonesome
Shading down behind the trees?
But don't your house look lonesome
When your baby's packed to leave

Blow wind, blow wind
Blow my baby back to me
Blow wind, blow wind
Blow my baby back to me
Well you know if I don't soon find them
I will be in misery

Goodbye baby
That is all I have left to say
Goodbye baby
That is all I have left to say
But you have lost your good thing
Go ahead and have your own way
