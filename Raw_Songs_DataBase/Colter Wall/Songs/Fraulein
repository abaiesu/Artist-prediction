Far across the deep blue water
Lives an old German's daughter
On the banks of the old river Rhine
There I loved her and left her
Now I can't forget her
She was my pretty fraulein

Fraulein, fraulein look up toward the heavens
Each night when them stars start to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty fraulein

When my memories wander away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
Her face comes before me
The face of my pretty fraulein

Fraulein, fraulein look up towards the heavens
Each night as the stars start to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty fraulein
You are my pretty fraulein
