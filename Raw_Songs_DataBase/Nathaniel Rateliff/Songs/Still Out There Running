Yeah baby, we'd set the whole thing on fire
I was the king of standing alone
Looking back to see how far you've flown
I ain't grown and I ain't changed at all

Yeah honey, you could say I'm afraid
Afraid my voice don't even sound the same
There's some pitch I can't even hear at all
Push my voice now to hear it stall
I'm choking on every word

Yeah maybe, we could find a place to stretch our wings
Rest upon cliffs overlooking scenes
Scenes we don't write and we don't fall between
Ah, we're just falling again

Wake me up
See the fire has fully surrounded us
Hey I know as I'm coughing up all the ashes
Of the friends and the love I used to know
It's still out there running

Yeah baby, we could set the whole thing ablaze
Watch the crowd's eyes open amazed
They're just standing in the smoke of the dead
Hear them whispering their stories man
It'll never change the time they're gone

Hey honey, you think that I'm a fool to be
So deep in it now that I can't see
I just wait for you to call my name
Ain't it always been the same
We just keep passing on the wrong time

Yeah maybe, maybe we'll go to the other side of town
Remember that old house, baby we ran down
The nights on the floor were so perfect then
Remember when the sun was coming up that red
And the fire in our bed

Yeah baby, we could set the whole thing on fire
I was the king of standing alone
Looking back to see how far you've flown
I ain't grown and I ain't changed at all
Looking down to see how far you've fallen

Wake me up
You see the fire has fully surrounded us
Hey I know as I'm choking upon the ashes
Of the friends and the love I used to know
I used to know back then
