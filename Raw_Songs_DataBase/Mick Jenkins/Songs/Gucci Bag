"... Dividing and conquer, not stop
So easy for us to love each other 'cause we so fucking fly
Look at our skin, this shit is golden red, black, chocolate
Our hearts is made of diamonds and-
And we treat ourselves like motherfu... like like we can't see that, man."

Uh, funky flowers in my Gucci bag
Lowkey balling like a Boosie fade
And I'm pulling up like Melo, red and yellow
Kill a fellow, watch for snakes, they don't take a break
We don't need no sleep, we been sleep, need to stay awake
Stay alert, we just play aloof 'til I'm Beowulf
Bayonet, I don't gotta shoot, all my shit is sharp
Get some flint, I do more than sparks with the penmanship
I be on that art over censorship
Niggas need Sensidyne to hold the truth within they lips
Making love when they kiss their teeth
Just bring the same energy that you had on the internet
False flagging, I ain't into that
I'm in the paint like Rembrandt
Where your sinners at?
Where you eating dinner at?
We'll infiltrate, you imitate
We innovate, we in the field
We Holyfield, we here you biting, now you Hollywood
And I'm just getting high and writing, I got


Uh, funky flowers in my Gucci bag
Lowkey balling like a Boosie fade
And I'm pulling up like Melo
Niggas egos give me chills
I  that bitch and 
My song ain't worth no 100 mil
Look boy, I do this shit for real
You know how that feel

Yeah, I don't need a cosign, I'm in my own tangent
Seeing all the angles, working through semantics
Got niggas frantic
They want me down with dog, I've been praying mantis
Look, we ain't flipping yola, we just doing yoga
Stretching while you stressing out about your wallet
Step my training up to hyperbolic
Chambers got my brain on brolic
So I wanna block the knowledge
'Cause they know that shit could spread like Bubonic
Shift the plate, tectonics, 'cause a sonic boom
From the tonic room, shake the seismic charts
This shit art, this shit part Red Seas, talked to burning bushes
Had to learn to keep pushing, fuck how niggas looking
I've been out her burning kushes, I got

Uh, funky flowers in my Gucci bag
Lowkey balling like a Boosie fade
And I'm pulling up like Melo
Uh, funky flowers in my Gucci bag
Lowkey balling like a Boosie fade
And I'm pulling up like Melo
Niggas egos give me chills
I  that bitch and 
My song ain't worth no 100 mil
Look boy, I do this shit for real
You know how that feel?
