I mean really
It's some sick shit ain't it
The man has lost his mind almost 'bout as quick as he found it
And it's dark in there
In his mind
He done asked himself questions to which no answer be
Damned if he know
Damned if we don't find out
I don't see no ladder
But they keep telling us to climb out
It's dark down here
How is it that we come to quantify the whole of a man 
Only by what he looks like in the light
Well
Dot dot dit dit dot dot dash
