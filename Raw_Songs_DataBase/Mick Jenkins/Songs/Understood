Ay, pull up puffin' on the indo
Chevy sitting up on Lorenzo's
Old head hit me with the head nod
Understood a nigga like 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
Old head hit me with the head nod

Deep conversations about language, which one you speak?
A lot of niggas claim bilingual, lie through they teeth
Tryna talk money, it's on the tip of they tongue
You know the feeling when the word's just outside your reach?
Take a few steps in you outside your territory
Make em lean back like Terror Squad when you're telling stories
Or even like you got the ac' in ya
So many different vernacular perspective and points
Went from selecting electives to collecting the coins
To rejecting investments, to connecting with legends
And stressing acceptance
To fuck it I write with my left, I'm finessing this joint with my right
To bring the light, like a key on a kite
The rolling thunder make them pee on theyself
I see the fire, I've been drinking Freon
I'm on the corner, feel like Dion with these Cowboys
Don't speak snake with these Malfoys though
No sweat on my towel boy flow
Brought the funk like an outhouse
The bumps like a bounce house
And spit like the beatbox the heat rock the Pete Rock Headnod

Ay, pull up puffin' on the indo
Chevy sitting up on Lorenzo's
Old head hit me with the head nod
Understood a nigga like 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
Old head hit me with the head nod

Yeah, we say a lot to say a little
And sometimes we say the most when we ain't really saying shit at all
Cotton mouth, I swear I spit it all
I spit it all on the paper
I'm twisting all of this paper
I'm spending all of this paper, for retail therapy
Brim low, they still can tell it's me
They say they want the kid in Tel Aviv
And what that tell the world?
I know you're smelling me
My fingers recently wrestled the evergreen
Been 100 proof, the message is everclear
Speaking for the crew, I'm playing Ms. Everdeen
Peculiar?
Yeah, I study Ms. Peregrine, my pedigree?
Duke Nukem, yo Eukanuba just let it be
Falling out of harmony, we singing different melodies
Really ain't spoke the same language in a long time
Both like to claim it's only 'cause the different latitude
Long lines at shows got me distant with my attitude
A matador, I know you mad at me
I ain't even mad at you, Not good with math...

Ay, pull up puffin' on the indo
Chevy sitting up on Lorenzo's
Old head hit me with the head nod
Understood a nigga like 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
Old head hit me with the head nod
