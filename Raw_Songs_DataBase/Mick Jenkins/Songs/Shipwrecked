When it's the end of our fair lady
A million pieces lost at sea
Marooned is the crew
That's setting sail with me
Oh Lord we're sinking, God knows we fall
Set sail for Heaven, pray my soul won't get lost
Pray God accepts me, I know I'm wrong
But we've been shipwrecked, since we were gone

It was 91st first and Langley, we was 6 Deep
Steppin' up the stairs black Buick with a slick creep
Moving down the block we had froze (froze)
Felt the tension in my toes "Man who is that? I don't know"
Driving slow, many probably throw
See we was thrown off, it was New Years Eve
I still remember when my baby lungs blew them trees
I still felt like a saint when I drew that breeze
On the corners was I hangin' never bangin'
But I knew them G's, it's been tragic
Since Boy Meets World been savaged
But the goal was never really the beef, it's been cabbage
We kill for it, when we die we can't have it
But we can't kill the habit holdin' onto this boat 'til we shipwreck


 shore, I die same before the dawn
I watch my niggas die of 
They say the waves will wash our sin
That we were black because our skin
I know we gazed upon the promise, promise land

I've been in these Waters like the Titanic
Waves crashed down, you would've thought a nigga drowned
But I'm staring at the sky like "Why panic?"
Don't you know who I pray to? We've been lookin' like prey
I just caught this shit at the prelude, peace, I been keepin' it
Step into the wools, forever a black sheep to the herd
How you not heard about this nigga?
You think you feelin' the flow somewhere in the ceiling, I'm not hot
Trust I'll be bringin' it, a nigga get it like "Pop pop!"
I've been trying to give them what's good
But don't call it food for thought
Shit taste like a hot fry
Shit had a nigga so thirsty
I couldn't see straight it was like I was cock-eyed
Fam, tell them what you've seen on the southside
Tell them, tell them where you been, nigga
Tell them where you're going
Cold park whenever I was outside
Somebody shootin' nigga
Even when it's snowing, in the cold
You could see the people thirsty
Well, I gotta little water right here
You heard me, all you gotta do is take a sip
And I don't want your souls, and I don't want your gold
I just do it for the Free my nigga don't trip
Don't trip, I do it for the Free, my nigga don't trip
Don't trip, I do it for the Free, my nigga don't trip
Don't trip


Ten thousand tiny soldiers marching right through my heart
Couldn't keep me at bay
