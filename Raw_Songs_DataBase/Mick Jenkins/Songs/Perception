Wolves in disguise
How you supposed to see 'em with the wool in your eyes?
Sheep to the radio, we fooled their surprise
They ain't ever loved me, it's bullshit and lies


Puffin' on the flower, pull it through your nose
Not to say you bleed
But I'm Austin Powers, I remember gold
Tell me what you see, tell me what you know
Tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you know, tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)
Tell me what you see, tell me what you see
Tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)


Back down, we been up longer
Winter came, so you know I had to put the Mac down
Get my cuff on like a new suit
6'5, young Bruce Bruce
Pack strong, that's Bruce Banner off to vegitary
With the couscous, black clouds
'Bout to rain down on the new cool
Like it ain't shit, monsoon when we brainstorm, that's the same shit
Muthafucka, this is art trap, you can see the verses like I'm paintin' shit
With some paintballs, shots sound like Goose Goose
Willy Wonka, I got no cellings, if I do, I finna need a new roof, fuck a limitation
Regardless I was gonna be here, fuck an invitation, what's a golden ticket?
Tell these niggas I don't need the juice, show these niggas how I got the stripes
Now they look at me like I'm Beetle Juice with a zebra cape
Soo many vision how you see the truth
Court vision can't you see the floor?
I'mma lead the break in monotony
Treat the game like Monopoly, it's no snake shit
Just cottonmouth from the botany, I mean obviously we get it
It's obviously that this shit's circus
I'm obviously flee wit it, they'll take the world, they'll break the world
Then look at us like we did it, I'm...


Puffin' on the flower, pull it through your nose
Not to say you bleed
But I'm Austin Powers, I remember gold
Tell me what you see, tell me what you know
Tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you know, tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)
Tell me what you see, tell me what you see
Tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)


How do you not see the world?
Views from the fifth dimension
They slip intentions in every love
I've seen the promised person, who wings that will never fly
They call us special barrows
Carried us to our borrow, we see how we
I don't get why, why, why, why


I remember gold, tell me
Tell me what you know
Tell me what you see, oh
Tell me what you see, tell me what you see, oh
Tell me what you know

All of these niggas perceptions
Damn, all of these niggas perceptions
Damn, all of these niggas perceptions
