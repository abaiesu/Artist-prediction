I've been hiding out in plain sight
I've been getting high as hell, before these fucking plane rides
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
I've been hiding out in plain sight
I've been getting high as hell, before these fucking plane rides
Never plain clothes, that just can't fly
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes

Robert Geller, Watanade, Common Projects just to curve the groupies
I'm in Barney's, tryin' Marni copped it sooney sooney
Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, got the trees on me
Breeze on me, I might need to grab a new jacket
Double G's, couple G's on my new jacket
They used to tax a nigga, now I'm in a new bracket
New bracelet, link from Cuba, going too savage
Change five times nigga going to

I've been hiding out in plain sight
I've been getting high as hell, before these fucking plane rides
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
I've been hiding out in plain sight
I've been getting high as hell, before these fucking plane rides
Never plain clothes, that just can't fly
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes

Getting blunted in the Uber window tinted yea
