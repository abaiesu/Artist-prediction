Ooh (Konvict)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

When your love is strong and it comes from the heart
Ain't no man strong enough
Ain't no time long enough to tear it apart
And that's what we had, believe it or not
So on the final day I thought all the hurting pain will end up on top
So I won't cry 'cause you're goin' away
'Cause the chemistry we've got, it don't fade
I won't be wishing for better days
'Cause deep, inside I know our love stays the same

You gotta know
No matter where you are (You got me)
Baby, near or far (You got me)
Our love will never fade (You got me)
So let me hear you say it
Baby, I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there (No matter what)
Baby, I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there, there (No matter what)
'Cause I got you, baby, yeah

I never lie
'Cause you are the reason that my heart is beating, and I am alive
Before you go, thinking that I can't be replaced, no
I got you waiting for the rest of my life (Oh, you gotta know)

No matter where you are (You got me)
Baby, near or far (You got me)
Our love will never fade (You got me)
So let me hear you say it
Baby, I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there (Oh, no matter what)
Baby, I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there (No matter what)
Baby, I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there (No matter what)
I'll be there, I'll be there, there(No matter what)
'Cause I got you, baby, yeah

I'll hold you up (When you just can't stand)
I'll make you cry (When you think that you can't)
By my side forever (Baby, that's the plan)
I'll be your everything, I'll be your everything, oh (I got you)
Whoa, oh

No matter where you are (You got me)
Baby, near or far (You got me) (I got you, baby)
Our love will never fade (You got me)
So let me hear you say it
Baby, I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there (Whoa, no matter what)
Baby, I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there, there (I'll be there)

Say you got me, I want you, baby
Say you love me, I need you, baby
I got you, baby, oh-oh, you got me
I'll be there, I'll be there (I'll be there for you)
I love you baby, I love you darling
I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there
