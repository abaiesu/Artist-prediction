If it's love that you're running from
There is no hiding place
Just your problems, no one else's problems
You just have to face

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

Now if your first lover let you down
There's something that can be done
Don't kill your faith in love
Remembering what's become

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
We gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

Places behind you
There to remind you

If your first lover broke your heart
There's something that can be done
Gonna heal your faith in love
Remembering what's been done

But if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back


How far you been walkin' now
About 100 miles
You still got some more to walk
I know, I got a little more to go
I'm gettin' kind of tired but I got to keep on walkin'
I'm walkin' barefoot
You've got to walk and don't look back
