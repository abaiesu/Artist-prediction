You want me to leave, you want me to stay
You ask me to come back, then you turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers, then you wanna be friends
I'm losin' my patience, you're nearin' the end

One of these days you're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on has left you behind
Don't wanna be no mother, you know I'm no saint
Oh my, my baby, before it's too late

Treat me right, treat me right, open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light

Do you think I'm a fool, well you'd better think twice
I've had enough, baby, it's time you realize
That you can't have it both ways, that's no way to live
You've done all the takin', it's your turn to give

One of these days you're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on has left you behind
Don't wanna be no mother, you know I'm no saint
Oh my, my baby, before it's too late

Treat me right, treat me right
Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light, oh, treat me right

You want me to leave, you want me to stay
You ask me to come back, you turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers, then you wanna be friends
I'm losin' my patience, you're nearin' the end

Treat me right, treat me right
Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light, oh, treat me right

Treat me right, treat me right
Treat me right, treat me right
