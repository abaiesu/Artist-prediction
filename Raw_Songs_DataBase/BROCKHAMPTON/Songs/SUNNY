All I do is work and play
Tryna' find a place to stay
Tryna' find some food today
This shit is real hard okay? Okay
Take that, homie got the lysol spray, ain't it?
You don't wanna see all my bad days, ain't it?
You don't wanna see what I got to say, ain't it?
You don't wanna see my boys, man they ain't friendly

It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
And got no ice on me, yeah, still 'ferring how I dress on me
These dickies and I got these hoes from WalMart

I just saw my P.O, (what up, nigga?) he like me, though (he like me, though)
Clean money, tryna stay up out the streets though
7 days a week though {all day}
It's that heat though
My daddy called me said he seen my last video
Looking at a young me could'a had a heatstroke
In the middle of the summer with my negros
Cool cuts and snow cones, smoking to the ozone
Smokin' til its all gone, smoking til my folks come home
