I felt awesome when you walked in
You caught me doin' something that I should've never been caught with
I played the forest, my far trip, I tripped and I fell
Still think I'm living near Austin
Remember when I was trippin' off some wack shit?
When I thought the automatic had an answer
When I was jammin' out Beyonce like Sampha
And you broke up with me 'cause I'm a cancer
Our relationship was toxic, cancer
I fell in love with a dancer in Atlanta
I'm lying, I ain't a Drake-ass nigga
I'm more like Troye Sivan, with a whole lotta melanin
Send them bombs to your lawn
Grew up on Rockafella, so I'ma get a chain
And sing every song in the vain of your name
And this'll...


Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you
I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, uh
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you
I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, uh
