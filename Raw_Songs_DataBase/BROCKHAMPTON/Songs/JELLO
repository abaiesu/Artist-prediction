Do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all probably fraud
I think that my brain is fried
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around
Only few, I'm holding down

Hi, I live a wonderful life
Should've died twice but to whom I decide?
Life always better keep it two on the side
Need no music when my niggas arrive
We bein' red eye
Black man with some white guys
Keep your head up with that fourty
And at the appropriate time
They ask a question, like
"Didn't you perform at my best friend's birthday party
With your friends"
Go crazy, just bring the shawty
Bring the loud one with the blonde hair
Makin' out with Zayn in a lawn chair
They kick me out but I belong here
Hear these songs nigga
See this long hair
See these videos
Direct these hoes with no budgets though
And the fuck
Did I land a fuckin' TV show?
Met all my friends through Kanye West
And I ain't met him yet

Just shaved down to the baby face
Clothes on me cause it's a holiday
Fried, no sides at the restaurant
My sleep schedule like the power here, it's never on
Feeling like the past year a whole escapade
Four cars, need a motherfucking Escalade
Pack it up like a clown car
Bet you know my name from here to Hong Kong
Bet I get along
Make some comma , come on, watch 'em sing along
Ayy, err, err, put a night like (night like/life) dancing on a 
In the thunder car, rocked up in the Lumma
Incidental, I be better by the summer
I be better by the winter
I be hoppin' in the rental
Maybe Tesla for all my missus sitting in the volvo
Damn. Shouldn't my life?
Hmmmmmmm...
Sorry, do it all here

I'm moon-walking on the sun, hot
I used to live where the guns popped
Made some records then we moved out
Turned rap into the new pop
Bandanna, I'm the new Pac
I been blowing up, I can't stop
They need my niggas in the White House
I do business with the white folks
Bring that money back to black folks
Flip it, stimulate the cash flow
Economic, but I speak ebonics
LA turned me to an asshole
I been shopping down on Melrose
Still a nigga but I'm living different
I been looking at the bigger picture
So I don't hear 'em when they talking to me


I just wanna finally fall in love with
Maybe someone I can binge drugs with
Living like a prince but I'm dove-less
Playing my emotions, you a dumb bitch
Everybody talking on some gun shit
They don't even know where the bus sit
Cry nigga  a fucking kick back
Gotta leave those soft niggas at the kickback
Splittin' all my problems like a Kit-Kat
I finessed the night that we slipped up
I could let you know where I'm next at
Tell my baby girl where the brakes at
You know I got number one pick stats
Catch me on the field, it's a mismatch
More like an eclipse she couldn't miss that
Putting my appearance where my chips at
