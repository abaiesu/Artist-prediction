On a palace floor I see my soul
Banging through the doors, we swing 'em closed
We need glass or something strong
For the creeps when you come 'round

I feel like fucking on the west side our parents are all gone
Girl
These strangers are coming out about twice as strong
I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I'm everything I am
I'm everything I am
But you don't know me
I'm everything I am
With everything I am
You don't know me

Hold me down, I know I've lost control
Picking up all of my dirty bones
Oh I know there's something wrong
Freak me out when you come round

I feel like fucking on the west side our parents are all gone
And these strangers are coming out about twice as strong
I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I'm everything I am
I'm everything I am
But you don't know me
I'm everything I am
With everything I am
You don't know me
At all
At all, at all, at all
At all
At all (You don't know)
At all, at all, at all
At all
