Try to keep your cool
You got a grip, baby
But you just can't seem to fall
You know what we are
Took for granted, fell, we catch ourselves
Don't worry, baby girl
There's no one in the world
'Cause when you say I got a girl
Say it, I know it's killin' you
When I say you make my knees so weak
Then you know I'm missin' you


Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love


Send me to California
I'm tryna get so lost
Not turnin' up to a 9 to 5
Just wanna know why

No plate on a white Lexus
I blacked out on a random cliff
Summer nights, I saw things change
And you still 
Pleasure, something
Deep inside my chest
Long nights, long drives
Change across my face
Cowboy, ride it
That's my Wild West
Come on baby you can put it us
Come on baby you can put it on me


Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
