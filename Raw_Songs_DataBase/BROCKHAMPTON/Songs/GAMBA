I don't know why I wanna fuck with you
But all I know is that I really fuck with you
Really wish you didn't like to fuck with me
Wish you took that energy and trusted me
I get so exhausted when you fuss with me
'Cause all the time, could be spent in love with me
I know I need it and you deserve it
You like to size me up and see if it's all worth it
I don't know where it is now but I'm searchin'
I think you want what I don't ever want: be perfect
'Cause I ain't perfect, I just wanna be good to you
I would take my heart right off the hook for you
Wanna do the things I know I should for you
Standing by myself until I stood for you
If I knew this love I woulda looked for you
But I'm glad you found me, I'm glad you found me

Spit the diamond with us
Fuck taking the bus
I wanna whip to call my own
And a horn to call my own
All 14-15 of my niggas
To figure, ooo, that's a step-back
Ooo, my nigga, that's a step-back
If I had to choose I would not choose you
If I had to stop I would turn around and choose glue
If I had to hit the breaks I'ma stop right
If I had to choose I'ma not choose you
If I had to turn around, I'ma turn into some glue
If I had to hit the breaks I'ma stop right here, yeah
