Big old whiskey on them icy rocks
Flood down some veins like oxy does
I need fresh air, I need oxygen
Who the hell you foolin'? It's so obvious
I don't feel it, I don't see it, this is blasphemy
I can't help but feel like you is after me
Is you drinking for the pain? Is you drinking for fun?
There's a party outside, 'til the morning gon' come
Is you dancing all alone? Is you dancing for someone?
There's a party outside, know the night is young
Is you having fun?


Say we should just, say we should just, pray to work again
Puttin' diamonds on my back, puttin' diamonds on my back, yeah
Say we should just, say we should just, pray to work again
Puttin' diamonds on my back, puttin' diamonds on my back, yeah


But you know if I waste my time
Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night


I said, I said
Who that, who that, who that, who that
Looking in the shadows
Tryna catch me liberating spirits from the gallows
They wanna blackball me, but I held my avocados
Then they melt down like the hash we mix in our tobacco
Circle tighter than the Castro, they feeding you Castrol
You'd think that it's gas, you turn the key, it's a fiasco
Could be stronger than vibranium, don't mean that I ain't fragile
Grapple with reality to break out of these shackles


But you know if I waste my time
Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night


Suicidal thoughts, but I won't do it
Take that how you want, it's important I admit it
I'm afraid of commitment, don't know how to fix it
Maybe codependent, can't tell the difference
When the push comes to shove, I'd rather bend than break
But something's gotta give, ain't that what you say
When you're torn between reality, and a choice you could have made
I should have made, they're not the same, I'm not the same
Maybe I'm broken, either way I'm clinging on closely
I know it's not healthy, appreciate your patience
I know that I'm selfish, do my best to be selfless
I know that I'm changing, I know that I'm changing


I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
