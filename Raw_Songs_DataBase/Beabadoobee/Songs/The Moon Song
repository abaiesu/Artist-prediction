I'm lyin' on the moon
My dear, I'll be there soon
It's a quiet, starry place
Time's were swallowed up
In space, we're here, a million miles away

There's things I wish I knew
There's no thing I'd keep from you
It's a dark and shiny place
But with you, my dear
I'm safe and we're a million miles away

We're lyin' on the moon
It's a perfect afternoon
Your shadow follows me all day
Making sure that I'm okay
And we're a million miles away
