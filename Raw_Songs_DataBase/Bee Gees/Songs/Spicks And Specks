Where is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead

Where is the light
That would play
In my streets
And where are the friends
I could meet
I could meet

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where is the girl I loved
All along
The girl that I loved
She's gone
She's gone

All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away

Everybody
Spicks and specks
Spicks and specks, yeah, ah
(Ah) spicks and specks
Spicks and specks
