Watching all the hours
Counting all the flowers that I grow
Think I'm slow

Sitting on the inside
Watching all the outside people go
Think I'm slow

Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time

Mr. Weeping Willow lazing on my pillow knows my mind deep inside
Tells me all the stories listens to the worries that I tried to keep inside

Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time

Da na na na na na-na
Na-na na na na da-da-da

Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time

Think about the sunshine
Thinking of the night I'm on my own
Private phone

Watering the garden
Trying not to harden things that grow
Think I'm slow

Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time

Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time
