Sweet simple song
Of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades
And all the world must play along
My life has been a song

Here as I sleep
The love I dream will gently creep
Inside my heart I softly keep
The tune that plays too long
My life has been a song

Every sound in my head
Every word that I said
Is like a melody, melody
That no little person like me
Could ever change
Every sound in the street
All the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony, symphony
Which has never before been rearranged

Sweet simple song
Of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades
And all the world must play along
My life has been a song

Every sound in my head
Every word that I said
Is like a melody, melody
That no little person like me
Could ever change
Every sound in the street
All the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony, symphony
Which has never before been rearranged

Sweet simple song
Of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades
And all the world must play along
My life has been a song

Every sound in my head
Every word that I said
Is like a melody, melody
That no little person like me
Could ever change
Every sound in the street
All the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony, symphony
Which has never before been rearranged
