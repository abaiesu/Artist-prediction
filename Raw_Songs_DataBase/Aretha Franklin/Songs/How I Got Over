How I got over how I got over
How I got over how I got over
You know my soul looks back and wonder how I got over
How I got over how I got over
How I got over how I got over
Oh, my soul looks back and wonder how I got over

Just as soon as I see Jesus oh yes
The man who made me free oh yes oh yes
It was the man who bled and suffered oh yes oh yes oh yes
You know he died for you and me oh yes

I wanna thank him
Because he brought me oh yes
I wanna thank him
Because he taught me oh yes oh yes
I wanna thank because he kept me oh yes oh yes oh yes
Cause he left me oh yes
I gonna thank God he never left me, oh yes

I wanna sing hallelujah 
I might shout this evening trouble over
I'm gonna thank Jesus for all he's done for me

Oh yeah, how I got over, over 
My soul looks back and wonder how I got over
Oh yeah, how I got over, over 
My soul looks back and wonder how I got over

I wanna wear a diadem
In the new Jerusalem
I wanna walk the street of gold
In the homeland of the soul
I'm going to view the host in white
Who travel both day and night
Coming up from every nation
On the way to the great coronation

I will sing hallelujah
Trouble over
I wanna thank Jesus for all he's done for me 
How I got over, over
My soul looks back and wonder how I got over
How I got over, over
My soul looks back and wonder how I got over
How I got over, over
My soul looks back and wonder
Soul looks back and wonder
Soul looks back and wonder
Soul looks back and wonder how I got over

I wanna thank you thank you 
Thank you thank you 
Thank you
Thank you Jesus thank you Lord
Thank you Lord thank you 
Thank you Jesus thank you Lord
You brought me
You taught me lord
You kept me 
And you never left me
Thank you Jesus
Thank you Lord
How I got over how I got over
How I got over how I got over
My soul looks back and wonder how I got over

Soul looks back and wonder how I got over
Over, over
Soul looks back and wonder
Soul looks back and wonder
Soul looks back and wonder how I got over
