When I go for a walk
And meet old friends we knew
We sit around and talk
Then they ask about you
What's the good if I say
That you and I are through 
I should tell them you're okay
When they ask about you

They wonder where we've been
And why we fail to call
And I take it on the chin
Until the teardrops fall
They 
They 
They 
Don't mean to be smart
But if they only knew
They're stepping on my heart
When they ask about you
They're stepping on my heart
When they ask about you
