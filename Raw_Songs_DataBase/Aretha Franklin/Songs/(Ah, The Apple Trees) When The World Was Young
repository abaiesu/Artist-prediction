It isn't by chance I happen to be
The belle of the ball, the toast of Paris
Over the noise, the talk and smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke
I walk in a room, a party or a ball
"Come sit over here" somebody will call
A drink for my friends, a drink for them all
But how many times I stop and recall

Ah, the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lying in the hay, games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young

Wherever I go they mention my name
And that in itself is some sort of fame
"Come by for a drink, we are having a game"
Wherever I go, it's so glad I came
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine
There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine
And thousands of men, some who are mine
But often my eyes see a different shine

Ah, the apple trees, sunlit memories
Where the hammock swung
On our backs we'd lie looking at the sky
'Til the stars were strung
Only yesterday, when the world was young
