Sweetheart, the night is growing old
Sweetheart, my love is still untold
A kiss that is never tasted
Forever and ever is wasted

For all we know we may never meet again
Before you go make this moment, uh, sweet again
We won't say goodnight, not until the last, the very last minute
I'll hold out my hand and nothing but my heart will be in it

For all, for all we know this may only be a sweet dream
But we come and we've got to go, just like the ripples on a stream
Oh, love me, love me tonight, tomorrow was made for some
But for us tomorrow may, may never come, for all we know
