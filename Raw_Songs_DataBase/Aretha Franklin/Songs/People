People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

Lovers are very special, special people
'Cause they're the luckiest people in the world
One person, just one very special person
A feeling so deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first, be a person who needs people

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
