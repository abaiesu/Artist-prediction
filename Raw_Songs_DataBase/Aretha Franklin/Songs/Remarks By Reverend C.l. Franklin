Aretha and to all of the musicians in this great choir
That took me all the way back to the living room at home
When she was about 6 and 7 years of age
I saw you cry
And I saw you respond
But I was just about to bust wide open
You talk about being moved

Not only because Aretha, my daughter, Aretha is just a strong singer
Reverend James Cleveland knows about those things
When James came to prepare Aqua for a gospel broadcast
Which is still in existence
And he and Aretha used to go in the living room
And spend hours in there
Singing different songs
She's influenced greatly by James
If you wanna know the truth
She ain't never left the truth
