Spied the armada in sight of the shore line
A sense of foreboding never tasted before

Fell through the floor, I've hit my ceiling
Out of my depth, over my head

Cloud Cuckoo-land was clearly in view
My magic bullet, blunt and unglued

Fell through the floor, bounced off the ceiling
Bolt for the door, out of my head

A voice from the north shouted: "Do it my way"
I went through the roof in a no-no display

I threw myself flat on to your border fence
The damage I did is in self defence

Fell through the floor, I reached my ceiling
Out of my depth, over my head
