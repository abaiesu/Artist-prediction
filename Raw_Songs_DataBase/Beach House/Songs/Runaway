My little runaway
Your heart can't take the games you play
It cuts you like a razor blade
My little runaway

The night has just begun
Can you cover what you're hiding from?
Something beautiful and dangerous
What we keep close to us

My little runaway
I wonder where you are
Will you be back someday?
My little runaway

I wonder where you are
Are you sliding down the tops of cars?
Your hair melting into silver stars
May you never go too far

My little runaway
Your heart can't take the games you play
It cuts you like a razor blade
You need to runaway
My little runaway
I wonder where you are
Will you be back someday?
My little runaway
