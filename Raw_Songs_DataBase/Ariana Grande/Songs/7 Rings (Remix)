Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)


I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (This who they waitin' on)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (2 Chainz, yep)


My ideas are priceless, I know I'm the nicest
I knew you would like this, I must be psychic
I'm from the streets, baby, I'm nothing like them (Tru)
She's sweet in the day, but freaky when night come (Tell 'em)
It's mine, invest it (Uh); I spend it on necklace (Uh)
I got the cash if I don't get credit (Uh)
And I'm well respected so she feel protected
So scratch all the exes (Ex), it's next like contestants (Woo)
It's blessings, no stressing, I'm flexing
Got one car parked right in the entrance
Got one car parked right at the exit
See, you didn't expect this, you think like a robot
I put bands in yo face like Botox


(Yeah) I want it (Yeah), I got it, I want it, I got it (Uh)
I want it, I got it (Uh), I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)


Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)
