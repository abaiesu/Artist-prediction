Realize you and I are in the same boat, same boat, yeah
Kills me, how you love me, then you
Cut me down, I'll do the same
We've been living like angels and devils, devils

I'm loving the pain
I never wanna live without it
So why-y-y-y-y-y do we try-y-y-y-y?
You drive me insane
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder
So why-y-y-y-y-y do we try-y-y-y-y?

Through it all you could still make my heart skip, heart skip
Oh yeah
Even when you're yelling at me
I still think you're beautiful
Through it all you could still make my heart skip, heart skip

I'm loving the pain
I never wanna live without it
So why-y-y-y-y-y do we try-y-y-y-y?
You drive me insane
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder
So why-y-y-y-y-y do we try-y-y-y-y?
You got me like na-na-na-na na-na-na
