Trembling
When you touch
Rush is racing
Body begging
Picture me

Making sweet love

If you like what you see

It's your birthday
Every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A.S.A.P.

It's your birthday
Every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A.S.A.P.

Can I, can I, can I please put my hand on it?
Shaking like they're burning, lemme put a fan on it
Bumblebee got the parachute to land on it
Girl you got the cake, can I put my candle on it?

It's your birthday
Every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A.S.A.P.
Got me talking marriage
I like what I see
Imma put a ring on it
Word to Bey and Jay-Z
But before I do that let me put a hand on it
Oh so hot I could catch a tan on it
Got me sweating so much we can swim on the dance floor
We gon' have to mess around and put a dam on it
Dam on it


I love the way it feels
Stay back and keep still
Your hands softly (softly)
Please don't take 'em off

Don't take 'em off
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
(Ah, baby)
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Don't take 'em off
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby put your hands on me
