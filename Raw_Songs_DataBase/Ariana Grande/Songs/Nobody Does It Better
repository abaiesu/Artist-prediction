So what we gon' do?
So what you gon' do?
So what we gon' do?
So what you gon' do?

You said you'd never forget her
And she said she could change your life
It happened on the day you met her
A love at first sight made you blind

But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?
Yeah nobody does it

No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it better

Don't throw your heart out in a letter
Cause I already read your mind
You know you missed out on forever
And settled for a waste of time

But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?
Yeah nobody does it

No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it better

But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?
Yeah nobody does it (Say no one, say no one)

No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it better

So what we gon' do?
No-no-nobody does it
So what you gon' do?
So what we gon' do?
No-no-nobody does it better
So what you gon' do?
No-no-nobody does it better
No-no-nobody does it better
