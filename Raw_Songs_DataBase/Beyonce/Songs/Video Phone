I love how you approach me
Fresh white, with your pants hangin' grown-man low
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
No need to convince me anymore

Swag up, it's bright
One blade, it's tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby, you're doin' something right
You just canceled every other man here

You can see that I got it goin' on

We can shoot the video right here on my cellphone

I never seen a smile so pretty
I need to know I'll always have you with me
So, take your picture on my video phone
You can pick your own song
And you could be the only one

Turn you into a star? I got it like that, like that
Baby, don't fight it
'Cause when I miss your call I hit you right back
On my video phone
