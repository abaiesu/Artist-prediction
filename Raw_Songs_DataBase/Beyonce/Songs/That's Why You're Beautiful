Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul, baby
And that's why you're beautiful

I'm not wondering why
The sky's blue. That's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

Lovers used to make love
And died just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love
Wasn't it beautiful?

Don't ask me why
The sky's blue. That's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

Diamonds used to be coal (Be coal)
Look young 'cause they got soul (got soul)
And my heart used to be cold (be cold)
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be you

That's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful

Why, why?

That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
