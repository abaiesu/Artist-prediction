Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

I was out shopping thinking of something I should get you
Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face
And let you know I'm happy you're my best friend
Part of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Take some time out, starting with today
For my babe

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight tonight, tonight
Tonight tonight, tonight
Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Let's pop a bottle of the vintage that I bought you!
I'll model sexy pictures right on top of you
Ten years together, still feels like we're making love for the first time
Like I'm in high-school sneaking with my boyfriend
All of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always here to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today
For my babe

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight tonight, tonight
Tonight tonight, tonight
Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Boy, if you just call, I'm on my way
When it comes to my baby, I bring my best
I just wanna party tonight
'Cause it's obvious to see that you're all I wanna be
Uh, just let me look at you!
Uh, you look so sexy boy, I wanna taste!
All unwrapped and on its way
When I groove with you
Oh, you'll feel so good boy you're my favorite place
Just come and lay up under me!

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight tonight, tonight
Tonight tonight, tonight
Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
