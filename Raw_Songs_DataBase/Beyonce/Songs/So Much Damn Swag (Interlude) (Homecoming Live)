I grew up in Houston, Texas
Visiting Prairie View
We rehearsed at TSU
For many years in Third Ward
And I always dreamed of going to an HBCU
My college was Destiny's Child
My college was traveling around the world
And life was my teacher
I wanted a black orchestra
I wanted the steppers
I needed the vocalist
I wanted different characters
I didn't want us all doing the same thing
And the amount of swag is just limitless
Like the things that these young people can do
With their bodies and the music they can play
And the drum-rolls and the haircuts
And the bodies and the
It's just not right
It's just so much damn swag
