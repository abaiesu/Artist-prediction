Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Life doesn't always work out like you planned it
They say, "Make lemonade out of lemons,"
But I try and I just can't understand it
All this trying for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask, Honey?
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn't matter now
The sun's setting on our love, bye, baby

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Life doesn't always work out like you planned it
They say, "Make lemonade out of lemons,"
But I try and I can't understand it
All this begging for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask, Honey?
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn't matter now
The sun's setting on our love, bye bye, baby

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

It doesn't matter what they say
Let's go do it anyway
Cause you and I have an undying kind of love
You can be mine, I'll be yours, c'mon baby

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that
