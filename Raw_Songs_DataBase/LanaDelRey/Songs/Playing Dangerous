Everybody knows I'm a good girl officer
No, I wouldn't do a thing like that, that's for sure
The house was already on fire, I swear I'm not a liar
Well I'm a little shaken, but I'm fine, thanks for asking
Tell me, do you always work alone so late?
Gosh, I'm a little shy standing here in my nightgown
Do you really have to put those tight handcuffs on?

Looking at me, then suddenly
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

Let's get in the back of your cop car, officer
You can ask me anything you want
Anything, anything

Do you have a girl?
I don't see a ring on your finger
Well that's interesting have you
Ever thought of dating a singer?

The flames are getting higher
So is my desire
It's kind of exciting
Don't you think?

Then suddenly he is uncuffing me
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire
Boy, love is strange
Sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire
Boy, love is strange
Sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you down

I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
