Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe

White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like making me crazy
Tell me "Have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In making me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lies and black beaches

Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe (What? What? What? What? What?)

Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you dating
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playing
Boo, let's get acquainted (what?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (What? Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (Ooh, what?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But banking like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hating (Yeah)
What? (what? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Bopping (What?)
Milly Rocking (What? What?)
She just might become my lover for real (for real, for real)
I might fuck with her all summer for real (for real, for real)
They better not holler if I cuff her for real (for real, for real)
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

Going bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real (for real, for real)
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out (top out, hop out, hop out)
High tops in the summer
Hop out (top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer, babe
Hop out (top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer
Hop out (top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer
