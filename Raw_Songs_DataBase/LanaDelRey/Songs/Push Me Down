Pull my hair, push me down
Knock me flat on the ground, push me down
Pull my 'tails, turn me 'round
Baby, do it right now, push me down
In the dark, you can do
Whatever you want to, right now

Hell on wheels, leather vest
Doing what you do best, kiss my mouth
Be a man, make a mess
Can you turn it out, yes, kiss my mouth
In the dark, you can do
Whatever you want to, yeah-yes
In your heart, yeah you knew
I was meant for you, too, didn't you, yes?

(One, two, three, four)
I'm your little baby doll
You my Mr. Rock 'n' Roll King
Make me wanna sing, sing for them all

(One, two, three, four)
I'm your little baby doll
You my Mr. Rock 'n' Roll King
Make me wanna sing, sing for them all

Dress me up, drive me 'round
Know you're loving my sound, drive me 'round
Hit me up, mess around
Get me drunk on the town, mess around
You're a fool, but you're cool
And I know that you'll do what you want
Whatever that is
Be a good baby, you should be getting me whatever I want

(One, two, three, four)
I'm your little baby doll
You my Mr. Rock 'n' Roll King
Make me wanna sing, sing for them all

(One, two, three, four)
I'm your little baby doll
You my Mr. Rock 'n' Roll King
Make me wanna sing, sing for them all

Motel swimming pool
Breaking in, we can do
Whatever you want
'Cause we're young and dumb
Sexy fool, make me drool
Loving you is bad news
But you're what I want

Ooh baby, ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
Pushing me down
Ooh baby, ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
Kissing me now

Keep it up, baby, love you a lot
And I'm not gonna stop
Mix it up, keep it fun
Boy, we're crazy and young
So don't stop
In the dark, we can do
Whatever you want to, yeah-yeah
