Little hands, little feet
Tiny heart, tiny beat
Oh, thinkin' about the time we spent falling in love (in love)
I don't wanna leave you
I don't wanna deceive you
But, oh, when mama cries from daddy's lies
Oh, my, please don't take him away, no, no, no
Don't take him away

Oh, 'cause I had my doubts, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close
I hope I stay close

All the pain, all the tears
Many nights, many years
This love for me is fading
You waited, but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together
When you see me with some other one and they know your son
Oh, please don't take him away
You say you won't but you will

Oh, 'cause I had my doubts, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close
I hope I stay close

There was a time before you, and there will be a time after you
Though these bodies are not our own
Walk tall, little one
Walk tall
Let me hold you
Let me hold you
