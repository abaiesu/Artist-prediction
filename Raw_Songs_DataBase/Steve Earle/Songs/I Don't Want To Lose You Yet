Baby it's a cold hard world out there
Broken hearted people everywhere
Takin' whatever love they get
I don't wanna wind up like that, so


Baby throw your arms around my neck
Lay your pretty head against my chest
Listen to one heartbeat then the next
'Cause baby I don't wanna lose you yet

You know I love you and I know you love me
It's everything that love's supposed to be
But I don't wanna look up one day
And find out we let it slip away



Can't tell you nothin' 'bout love I guess
That you don't already know
But girl, when you're in my arms like this
I don't ever wanna let you go

Baby maybe I'm wrong but what it I'm right
And everything's depending on us tonight
Maybe we'll pass this way again
But honey I don't wanna wait 'til then, so
