You come with me to Memphis

Rez wants to keep me here, because you know, they rushed out the single and they're so excited that they want me to finish the album, so I'm working on that

Listen to what you saying... listen to what you just said. People wanna hear what you have to say. That's the stuff right there

I-I-I can't...

Hey, hey, take it in
