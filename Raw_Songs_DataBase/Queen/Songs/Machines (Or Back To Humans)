Machines, machines
Machines machines
Machines, machines

It's a machine's world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for rock'n'roll

They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man

They freeze me, they burn me
They squeeze me, they stress me
With smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me
But no one, but no one, but no one can wrest me away

Back to humans

We have no disease, no troubles of mind
We are fighting for peace, no regard for the time
We never cry, we never retreat
We have no conception of love or defeat

What's that machine noise?
It's bytes and mega chips for tea
It's that machine, boys
With random-access memory

Never worry, never mind
Not for money, not for gold

Its software, its hardware
Its heartbeat, its time-share
Its midwife's a disk drive
Its sex life is quantised
Its self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised
