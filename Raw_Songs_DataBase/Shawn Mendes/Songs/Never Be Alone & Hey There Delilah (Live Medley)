Woah...
(New York City sing that out)
Woah...

I promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe
I'll keep you sound

Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down

But hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about
But I can't stay
Just let me hold you for a little longer now, yeah

(Sing it out)

Take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone, oh
Woah...

You'll never be alone
When you miss me close your eyes
I may be far but never gone
When you fall asleep tonight just remember that we lay under the same stars

And hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about
But I can't stay
Just let me hold you for a little longer now

And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone 
You'll never be alone 


Woah...

Hey there Delilah
What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right here if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes

Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side
(Sing!)
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 
Oh it's what you do to me 


(Stay with me)
Woah...
(Can you guys clap your hands along to that)
Woah...
(Do not stop clapping, whatever you do keep on clapping..)
(The goal here is to get every single person in this arena
To sing this as loud as they can. Can we do that?)
(New York, if there's any city in the world that can do that it's you guys so.. let's do it)
(Keep on clapping, alright here we go)

Woah...
(Beautiful keep on going!)
Woah...
(You sound absolutely incredible right now! Keep on going sing it!)
(Woah...)
Woah-ah, yeah
(Sing it out)
Woah...
(This last one is all you guys, all yours, sing)
Woah...

And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
Never be alone. (Oh, yeah)
You'll never be alone

(I love you guys, thank you so much)
