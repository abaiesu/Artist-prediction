Here I am, stuck on this couch
Scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah

Waking up to headlines
Filled with devastation again
My heart is broken
But I keep going

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it
Yeah, I know it

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

It's hard to sleep at night
Knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless
I need focus

You hit me with words 
I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest
I don't want it, no

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (youth away)

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
