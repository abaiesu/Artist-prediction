Oh
You were crying, when I told you that
I was leaving and might never come back
Hmm, I was dreaming of a warmer place
And if I made it, it'd be okay

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California

All those dreams that, one by one came true
Felt like nothing, cause I wasn't with you
And tell me what that means
And tell me why I'm dying
Thought this was what I needed
But that was a mistake

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, And I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California

You were crying, when I told you that
I was leaving, now I wanna come back

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California, yeah
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California
