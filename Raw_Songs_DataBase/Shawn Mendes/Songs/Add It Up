Day after day, I will walk and I will play
But the day after today, I will stop and I will start

I've given you a decision to make
Things to lose and things to take
Just as she's about ready to cut it up
She says, "Wait a minute, honey, I'ma add it up!"
Add it up! Add it up!
Wait a minute honey I'ma add it up

Day after day, I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow and say goodnight

Oh, mama mama mama-mo-ma-mum
Take a look now at what your boy has done
He's walking around like he's number one
Went downtown and you got him a gun

So don't you shoot that thing at me
Don't you shoot that thing at me
You know that you got my sympathy
But don't you shoot that thing at me

Day after day, I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow and say goodnight
Add it up, add it up
Wait a minute honey I'ma add it up
