You've got my heart
But I can't let you keep it, babe
Cause I won't be sure that I can stay
And don't waste your time
Trying to pull me in
Cause I'm just a mess
You don't wanna fix

Just promise me one thing that you won't forget
But for now kiss me softly before I say

And don't be a fool
And wait on me darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move

And don't be a fool
And say that you love me
Cause you'll find a man
Who will stand by your side
And will be there for you

And just know that I do
Oh I really like you babe
And I wanna be there for you
For the rest of your days
But I know that you'll hurt
If we keep on doing this
So I'm sorry to end this now
But I know that it's for the best

Don't be a fool
And wait on me darling, yeah
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move

And don't be a fool, yeah
And say that you love me
Cause you'll find a man
Who will stand by your side
And will be there for you

I don't think you'll ever understand
I don't think you'll ever understand
I know that you don't wanna hear this but darling please don't be a fool

Oh, don't be a fool, yeah
And wait on me darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move

Yeah...
Just don't be a fool, yeah
And say that you love me, girl
Cause you'll find a man
Who'll stand by your side
And will be there for you

And don't be a fool
And wait on me darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But don't be a fool
