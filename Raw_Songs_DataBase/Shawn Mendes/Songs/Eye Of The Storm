This morning I was listening to your heartbeat singing songs
I see you right beside me, but you're hardly here at all
You hate me 'cause I'm pulling off the covers picking you up out of this bed
I promise that it's only 'cause I love you so bad

And darling, I know that it's dark
But you're safe out here in my arms
I'll be right by your side
In the eye of the storm
And darling, I know that it's hard
Hold you close when it all falls apart
I'll be right by your side
In the eye of the storm
