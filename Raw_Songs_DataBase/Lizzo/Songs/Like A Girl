Uh (Go)

Woke up feelin' like I just might run for president (Run for president)
Even if there ain't no precedent (Nah)
Switchin' up the messagin'
I'm about to add a little estrogen (Huh, yeah)
Buy my whip by myself (By myself)
Pay my rent by myself (By myself)
Only exes that I care about are in my fucking chromosomes
I don't really need you, I'm Macaulay Culkin, "Home Alone"
Bad bitch, diamonds in my collarbone (Yee, yee)
Buy my whip by myself
Pay my rent by myself

Sugar, spice, and I'm nice, show me what you're made of
Crazy, sexy, cool, baby, with or without makeup
Got nothin' to prove (I got nothin' to prove)
But I'ma show you how I do

Find me up in Magic City, bustin' hundreds by the bands
And I throw it (Like a girl)
Go and throw it (Like a girl)
Hangin' out the 750, feelin' bossy in my city
'Cause I run it (Like a girl)
Run it, run it (Like a girl)
I work my femininity, I make these boys get on their knees
Now watch me do it, watch me do it, look it, look it, I'ma do it
Like a girl (Like a girl)
Like a girl (Like a girl)

Chaka Khan through the fire, light the kerosene (We can do it)
Lauryn Hill told me everything is everything (We can do it)
Serena Willy showed me I can win the Wimbledon (We can do it)
Uh, put me on a pedestal, bet on me, bet I will

Sugar, spice, and I'm nice, show me what you're made of
Crazy, sexy, cool, baby, with or without makeup
Got nothin' to prove (Got nothin' to prove)
But I'ma show you how I do (I'ma show you how I do)

Find me up in Magic City, bustin' hundreds by the bands
And I throw it (Like a girl)
Go and throw it (Like a girl)
Hangin' out the 750, feelin' bossy in my city
'Cause I run it (Like a girl)
Run it, run it (Like a girl)
I work my femininity, I make these boys get on their knees
Now watch me do it, watch me do it, look it, look it, I'ma do it
Like a girl (Like a girl)
Like a girl (Like a girl)

So if you fight like a girl, cry like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world
If you feel like a girl, then you're real like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world
If you fight like a girl, cry like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world
If you feel like a girl, then you're real like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world

Find me up in Magic City, bustin' hundreds by the bands
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I throw it (Like a girl)
Go and throw it (Like a girl)
Hangin' out the 750 (Hangin' out the 750, baby)
Feelin' bossy in my city
'Cause I run it (Like a girl)
(Yeah, I run it like a girl)
Run it, run it (Like a girl)
I work my femininity (Yeah, I work it, baby)
I make these boys get on their knees (Get on your knees, yeah)
Now watch me do it, watch me do it, look it, look it, I'ma do it
(Watch me do it)
Like a girl (Like a girl)
Like a girl (Like a girl)
(Oh, yeah)

(Shit, fuck, I didn't know it was endin' right there)
