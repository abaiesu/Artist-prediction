Her place was like an eyrie
The fall seemed very scary
Down to the strand
Please, I wanna be in your band

I see her body swaying
I hear her fingers playing
Her parlor grand
Please, I wanna be in your band

Oona, I will await destruction
Oona, I will await destruction
My owner, I'm Oona's

And automatic writing
I hear they do it nightly
Her wild jams
Please, I wanna be in your band
Please, I wanna be in your band

Oona, I will await destruction
Oona, I will await destruction
My owner, I'm Oona's

I hear her fingers playing
Her parlor grand
Please, I wanna be in your band
Please, I wanna be in your band
Please, I wanna be in your band

Oona, I will await destruction
Oona, I will await destruction
My owner, I'm Oona's
