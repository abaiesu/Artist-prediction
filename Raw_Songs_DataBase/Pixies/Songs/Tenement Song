The drumsticks were his treasure trove
Found in the ashes of The Cocoanut Grove

Hey, man, can you give me something?
Hey, man, did you give me something?
Hey, man, nothing comes from nothing
Hey, man, something came from somewhere

Hey, man, it's a tenement song
It's just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on

(Tenement song)
(Tenement song)
Tall bottle and one more smoke
(Tenement song)
She lived through the fire but the piano got broke
(Tenement song)

Hey, man, can you give me something?
Hey, man, did you give me something?

Hey, man, it's a tenement song
It's just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on

Hey, man, it's a tenement song
It's just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on
(On and on and on)
