Life is a game, it's a
And the only way you can participate in it
Is you have to get involved
With all your heart and soul
Your mind, oh, your mind
Is such a great thing, use it, use it
The positive has to overtake the negative
And no matter what people may say to you
Believe me, you have to get involved
In the game of life
Things don't always go the way you want 'em to
But hang in there
Don't be afraid, no matter what they say
You gotta take a chance at life
And you don't know how far you can go
And you won't know until you try
Set your sights for better things in life
And work for them hard as you can
Patience is key, it always sets you free
It's all about your master plan
People, sometimes
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Sometimes some things are so hard to do
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Sometimes some things are so hard to do
Make your move, be careful what you chose
You gonna reap what you sow
Make no mistake, you've got what it takes
And all it's gonna take is you
Patience is key, it always sets you free
And you can make it if you try
Don't waste time makin' up your mind
It's your choice, it's your life
Listen to me, people
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes some things are so hard to do
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes some things are so hard to do
They say that the mind
Is a terrible, terrible thing to waste
And so it's time, and it's time
That you made up your mind
About what you wanna do in life
Different strokes for different folks
We're all in this together
And what you have to realize is that
You can't always win and you can't always lose
Just sometimes, sometimes you do
Listen to me, people
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes some things are so hard to do
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes some things are so hard to do
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes some things are so hard to do
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
