It's no surprise, the way I feel
When you look at me I know your love is real
I never thought that I could feel this way

And I'm on fire, baby fire
I can't believe it's happening to me
I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire
And I will love you endlessly

You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You took this half a life of mine and made it whole
When we make love I lose control

Cause I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire
I can't believe it's happening to me
I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire
And I will love you endlessly

I hope that I can make you understand
How very much you mean to me
And the day we met, my life began
Because your love has set me free

Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire

I hope that this will never end
Cause I will never find a love like yours again
And I'll feel this way until the end

Cause baby I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire
I can't believe it's happening to me
I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire
And I will love you endlessly
Cause I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire

Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire
