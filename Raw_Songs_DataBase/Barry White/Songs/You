You, still awake my desire
And you make my love perspire
You, your passion makes me weak
I shiver down to my bare feet

I'm so glad we found each other
I'm so glad that we're together
We got something very special
I will always be so faithful

For you, you're so incomparable
Yeah, you're so sensual
You, so suave and debonair
Ain't no other guy in my eye
Who can compare

You, I'm never gonna leave you
You, I'll never deceive you
You, I never wanna lose you
You, I'll never misuse you

I'm so much in love with you
You're so in love with me
This is the way it will always be
Just you, just me

You make me scream your name
You light fire in my veins
You captivate my mind so
And when you're loving me I swear
I just lose control

I'm so much in love with you
You're so in love with me
This is the way it will always be
Just you, just me

You and me
You, help us, please
Who? You
