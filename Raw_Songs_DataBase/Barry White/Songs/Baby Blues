Certain things turn me on
Like the way you might say a word or
The way you wear your hair
You have a certain smile on your face

By just the way you're standing there right now
Now you really, really, really, look good to me, baby
In your baby blue panties, yes love, you look good to me right now
In your baby blues, them baby blues and you
