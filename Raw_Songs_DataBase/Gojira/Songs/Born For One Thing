Mortal, spawn on the altar
Caught in the heart of the blaze
The primal fear of disappearing
Becoming
A ghost in the void

Death

Give a price, put a name
None of it real in this matter
Wandering, distracting
Wishing the life of another
Self

We were born for one thing
Tame the greatest fear of all

We were born for one thing
Born to face the greatest fear of all

We're all drawn into ourselves
In a collective coma

Remember, gazing up for answers
But now we're staring down

Down
Down
Down

All is blur in the maze, we put an end to all

We were born for one thing
Tame the greatest fear of all

We were born for one thing
Born to face the greatest fear of all

We're no one
United
When we're gone
