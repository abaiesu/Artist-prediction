(Oh, oh, oh)
(Yeah)

Started off a team
Ballin' till we get the ring
We wanna compete
But it's the weekend
We should link and party
Till I need some ice on my knees
Chillin' with my niece, cousins, aunties
Come on everybody
What you bringin' to the pot luck? I'm excited
Everybody got a spot, love, you're invited
Hate is just lost love
So they hidin'
Never know try it
You just might like it

First, it was all love
Hands up super star love
That you can have it, you can have it all, love
But then you took it, took it all, love
All love
Turn it up louder
Sing along, get the crowd up
But then you took it all, love
Then forgot all about us but it's all love
(Oh, but it's all love)

Congratulations
You finally turned from the wrong station
Thank you for y'alls patience
I'll try not to make this a long statement
Momma said I shouldn't swear
So I'ma just put this on Dayton's

Nobody's born hatin'
Nobody's born fake
Why we fightin' over
Something we can all make?
That's stingy love
I'm just givin' love, ain't no givin' up
If you alive, only thing to do is live it up
