When I wear his shirt, it feels like, like his skin over mine
And the little holes and tears and shreds on in are, are, are the, the memories of the past that I wasn't there for, but, that somehow I, I feel like I understand more when it's against my skin
It's an armor, like a barrier from the world
Like, our secret nobody else knows and I like that, you know?
It makes me feel like a woman, it makes me feel sexy, it makes me feel... it makes me feel like I'm his...
