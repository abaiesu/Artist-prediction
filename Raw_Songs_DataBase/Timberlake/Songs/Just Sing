You think you've gotta hide it
Don't keep it on the shelf
Let your waist start movin'
Watch the way I do it, do it
See me do it like nobody else

If we sing it all together
(If we sing it all as one)
It's louder than yourself
(All together everyone)
Everybody's lookin'
Watch the way we do it, do it
'Cause we do it like nobody else

Let me hear you sing
Don't you stop it, don't you fight it
Let me hear you sing
If you got it, can't deny it
Let me hear ya
It's waitin' for ya already
You know that you do it like nobody else

Just sing
Sing it together
Louder than ever, ever
Forget everything
Just sing
Like it's what we've been missin'
And they're gonna listen, listen
Forget everything
(Let me hear ya)

Hey, I been right here where you standin'
(I've been standin' on the ground)
And the walls are cavin' in
(All the walls are fallin')
But my lips start movin'
With the soul I put into it
And you've never heard it done like this

Let me hear you sing
Don't you stop it, don't you fight it
Let me hear you sing
If you got it, can't deny it
Let me hear ya
It's waitin' for ya already
You know that you do it like nobody else

Just sing
Sing it together
Louder than ever, ever
Forget everything
Just sing
Like it's what we've been missin'
And they're gonna listen, listen
Forget everything

(Let me hear you sing!)
(Let me hear you)
Let me hear you sing, yeah!
(Let me hear you sing!)
I want you to sing from your soul, I want you to reach with your elbows
(Let me hear you)
(Let me hear you sing!)
It's waitin' for ya already
You know that you do it like nobody else

Just sing
Sing it together
Louder than ever, ever
Forget everything
Just sing
Like it's what we've been missin'
And they're gonna listen, listen
Forget everything

Just sing
Sing it together
Louder than ever, ever
Forget everything
Just sing
Like it's what we've been missin'
And they're gonna listen, listen
Forget everything
Just sing

Sing it together
Louder than ever, ever
Forget everything
Just sing
Like it's what we've been missin'
And they're gonna listen, listen
Forget everything
Just sing!
