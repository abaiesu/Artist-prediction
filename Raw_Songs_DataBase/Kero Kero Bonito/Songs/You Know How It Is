Oh, you know how it is
When you try, but nothing's going right
Oh, you know how it is
When you say you're doing fine

Now every day is just the same as all the ones before
You love your friends, but you don't even see them anymore

And I kinda feel like
Something is changing forever
But I can't figure out the reason why

Oh, you know how it is
When you try, but nothing's going right
Oh, you know how it is
When you say you're doing fine

Oh, you know how it is
When the sky is crashing down again
So there you laugh, but you really want to cry
'Til the tears run dry

You walk the park in silence, 'cause the kids have gone away
And maybe this is me
But the planes all seem to fly so low these days

And I kinda feel like
Something is changing forever
I can't be certain but I think you know

Oh, you know how it is
When you try, but nothing's going right
Oh, you know how it is
When you say you're doing fine

Oh, I know you do
'Cause I sure know it too
