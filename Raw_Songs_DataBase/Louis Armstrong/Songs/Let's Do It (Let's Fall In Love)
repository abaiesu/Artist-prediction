When the little blue birds
Who have never said a word
Start to say spring spring
When the little blue bell
In the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring ding ding
When the little blue clerk
In the middle of its work
Starts to tune to the moon up above
It is nature that's simpling telling us to fall in love....
Oh, yes and that's why...

Birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love...

In Spain the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it
Just think of the Siamese twins
Some Argentines, without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love...

Romantic sponges they say do it
Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Cold Cape Cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Electric eels, I might add, do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it
Waiter, bring me shadroe
In shallow shoals, English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love...

Dragonflies in the reeds do it
Sentimental centipedes do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Mosquitoes, heaven forbid, do it
So does every katydid do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

The most refined ladybug do it
When a gentleman calls
Moths in your rugs do it
Well let me ask, what's the use of balls?

Locusts in the trees do it
Why, even the bees do it
Even all educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love...

I said
The chimpanzees in the zoo do it
Some courageous kangaroos do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...
Oh, fall in love...

I'm sure that girafes on the slide do it
Every hippopotami do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Oh, sloths who hang down from the twigs do it
Though the effort is great
Yes, sweet guinea pigs do it
Buy a couple and wait

Now the world admits bears in the pits do it
Even pekigneses in the Ritz do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...
