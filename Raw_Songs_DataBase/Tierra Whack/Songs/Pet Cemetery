They took my dog away
They treat him like a stray
I talk to God today
(All dogs go to heaven)
(Heaven) I miss my dog
(Heaven) I kissed my dog
(Heaven) I miss my dog
(Heaven) I kissed my dog
(All dogs go to heaven)

My dog had a name
Keepin' his name alive
If I had to leave
Hell on earth (all dogs go to heaven)
My dog had a name (I'm gon' say his name)
Keepin' his name alive (I'm the one to blame)
If I had to leave (he would do the same)
Hell on earth (walkin' through the flames)

(Heaven)
(Heaven)
