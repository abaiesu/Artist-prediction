Reckoner
You can't take it with yer
Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet dis-tractor
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all human beings

Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
In rainbows
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore

Reckoner, take me with yer

Dedicated to all human beings
