You can keep what you want
I want none of this
They're just bad memories
I don't want
In my sunshine (shine, shine)
You can pack it all up
And be gone
And be gone

If it matters to you
You can sell it all up
If the price feels right
I won't judge

If you get off your knees
You'll be out on the breeze
Take a lesson from me
Don't get stuck on a dream
