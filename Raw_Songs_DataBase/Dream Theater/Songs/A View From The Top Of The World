The fire that burns within us
To carry out a dream
Chasing new ambitions
Determined to succeed
To stretch beyond our limits
To blaze a brand new trail
Bold enough to conquer
Brave enough to fail

Sheer determination
Taking nerves of steel
Always digging deeper
Danger all too real

To rise above the challenge
To push to the extreme
To the daring, there can be no in-between

See a view from the top of the world
Take a ride on the crest of a wave
The adrenaline rush over and over again
See a view from the top of the world

All my natural instincts
Are begging me to stop
But somehow I carry on
Heading for the top
A physical absurdity
A tremendous mental game
Helping me understand
Exactly who I am

To face a new adventure
To conquer the insane
Lured into madness
Addicted to the pain
Reaching for the summit
On the threshold of defeat
Rightfully joining
The ranks of the elite

See a view from the top of the world
Feel the wind on the edge of the sky
Take a chance you may die, over and over again
See a view from the top of the world



I begin the blind descent
To a place no one has seen
Returning to the womb
On the fringe of the unknown
A journey into darkness beckons me

Like a blind man in a maze
Who somehow finds an open door
The beauty and the danger
And the yearning to explore
Always keeps me coming back for more



The moment that you recognize
Just where your limits lie
Hanging on the brink of death
You're never more alive
When you reach the pinnacle
The world is at your feet
Welcome to the mind unleashed
The impossible is never out of reach
When barriers are broken, greatness is achieved
Self belief will build a life of legacy
