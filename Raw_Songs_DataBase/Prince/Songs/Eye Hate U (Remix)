Take of your clothes
Take of your clothes
Take of your clothes

I never thought that you would be the one
After all the things that we've been through
You gave your body to another in the name of fun
I hope you had some baby, if not, boo hoo

It's so sad but I hate you
Like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate you
'Cause you're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate you
Now everyday would be a waste of time
'Cause I hate you
I hate you

It's so sad that I hate you
I hate you
I hate you
'Cause I hate you
I hate you

It's so sad that I hate you
I hate you
I hate you
'Cause I hate you
I hate you
