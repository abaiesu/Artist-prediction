Good morning children
Take a look out your window
Our world is falling
It's almost time to go
(Dance)
Dance the Dance Electric
The rhythm is love and love is blind
Love your enemies
There isn't much time, there isn't much time

Look - our world is falling
A rhythmless house of blinded prophecy
Hear our Master calling
This isn't what He wanted us to be

We got to dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

Don't - it don't make you happy
To give another someone your own smile
Dance the dance electric
Never mind your hatred, try a brand new style

Dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

We... love... all... enemies

Look - you're livin' in Babylon
Makin', but not feelin' love at all
When your youth is gone, when it comes to dawn
A light of truth will shine and you will fall

That's why you got to dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

See the light inside of us
It's darkened if we live a life that's bad
Whatever you do, don't you let your light go dark my love
It's the only light that you will ever have

Why don't you dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go
(almost time to)
Dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go
