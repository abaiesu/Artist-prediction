Money on my mind, money on my mind
You see, the only real money is fast money
And with these niggas walk around with, that's little flash money
Baby don't buy it
I know he's a ball player, but he's not gonna spend it
He's been poor for much too long, so trust me


They thought I lay dead, I was playing possum
Spot me everywhere with the 8 like Kate Goslin
Niggas think they sit at the top, they just posturing
Now they hide their head like an ostrich
Optimus Prime and that gull wing
Feeling like I transform, niggas still hands on
Whip it like a sandstorm, had the audacity to sell it in a damn poem
Get you higher Angelo, the author of this anthems
Your punch lines are mere jabs, they see through
Like the clear glass on that coupe I steer past
Money on my mind like my pillow is a vault
You niggas is soft so on that pillow's where you talk
Can't find it in them d-list, actresses on mattresses
Your real chance to loving you bachelors, I laugh at them
Don't you know that it's money over bitches
Bitches love money, I granting them three wishes, Push

Shout out my nigga Don C, aka Givenchy Don C
Ya ain't even know that you got an aka did you, ah aha
Always in that fly shit, Mike Dean what up? Brendan
Or should I say international Brendan, Marcus Paul? Refresh, yeah
The fear of Gods in these motherfuckers
You can act like don't hear this shit man
Niggas ain't fucking with me man, no games, yeah
