People say you love but one at time
For every woman there's a man
My baby say she wasn't put here forever
So she's gonna get as many as she can
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do

Well, some people may be wrong sometimes
But they can't be wrong all the time
Like they say a cat has nine lives
Nine loves has the woman of mine
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do

Well, the women are funny these days
They do wrong in so many ways
They'll have a man twiddling his fingers
Or either drinking his life away
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do
