Oh baby
Babe, you know I go for you
Oh baby
Babe, you know I go for you
Aw, not because you dress so fine
Babe, but the little things you do

Oh, you're my all-day steady
Babe, you're my midnight dream
Oh, you're my all-day steady
Babe, you're my midnight dream
Oh, and without you, baby
Life ain't no good to me
