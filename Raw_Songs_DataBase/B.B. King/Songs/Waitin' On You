Yes, it's four o'clock
In the morning, baby
I'm sitting here waiting on you
Yes, it's four o'clock
In the morning, baby
I'm sitting here waiting on you
Yeah, you say you're going out dancing
But the dance hall closes at two

Yes, I know it's the weekend, mama
And everybody's having fun
Yes, the weekend, baby
And everybody's having fun
But when it's time for loving, baby
Remember that I'm the only one

Yes, I'm sitting here waiting, baby
Wondering what you're doing out there
Yeah, I'm sitting here wondering, baby
Wondering what you're doing out there
I can see you're with another man
Having fun without a care

Yeah, it's four o'clock in the morning
Baby, tell me, where have you been
Yes, it's four o'clock in the morning
Woman, tell me, where have you been
Yeah, you come on in here, woman
And don't let it happen again
