When that ev'nin' sun goes down,
Yeah, you'll find me hangin' around
Because the night life,
It ain't no good life but it's my life

Yeah, yeah, yeah listen to the blues,
Listen to what they're sayin'
Oh, please listen to the blues,
Listen to the blues they're playin'

Ah, ah, all of the people just like you and me,
They're all dreamin' about their old used to be
Because the night life,
It ain't no good life but it's my life

They tell me life's an empty scene,
An avenue of broken dreams
Because the night life,
It ain't no good life but it's my life
