The blues has got me 
And there is teardrops in my eyes
Oh, the blues has got me
There is teardrops in my eyes
Yes, dark is the night
Since my baby said goodbye

Oh, how I've suffered
Since my baby wnet away
Yes, how I've suffered
Since my baby wnet away
Yes, I've got that feeling
That my baby's gone to stay

Take me back, darling
Forgive me for the wrongs I've done
Ah, take me back, darling
Forgive me for the wrongs I've done
Now I know that I love you
And you're the only one

Talk to me baby
Call me on the telephone
Yes, talk to me baby
Call me on the telephone
Well, the blues has got me
And I want my baby home

If your baby loves you
Keep her home and treat her nice
Oh, if your baby loves you
Keep her home and treat her nice
Well, never mistreat a good woman
This is some doggone good advice
