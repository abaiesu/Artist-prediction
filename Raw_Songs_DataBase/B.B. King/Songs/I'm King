I've been around the world, seen everything
And if it's love you want baby just give me a ring
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues

I've loved in sunshine, I've loved in the rain
All of the women who know me call that loving man
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues

Some people go to school to try and learn their trade
Yes, but I'm a lover, a lover by nature
That's why I know, I know, I know I've got it made

Yes, you might think I'm jokin' or just havin' fun
But they tell me the reason I'm the king
I'm a lovin' son of a gun
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues
