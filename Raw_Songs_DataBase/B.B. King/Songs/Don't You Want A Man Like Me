Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
I can love you baby
Better than your used-to-be

Oh baby, don't you need a man like me
Oh baby, don't you need a man like me
I can love you baby
Better than any man in town

Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
I can love you baby
Better than your used-to-be
