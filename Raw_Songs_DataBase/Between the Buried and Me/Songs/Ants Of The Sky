...now
My teeth taste funny today...they seem more jagged than normal
I've been told, I've been told, I've been told that I have been grinding them like gears during my dream hours
I wonder if it's just my thoughts fusing into one frequent dream

One which parts with the night, the night

Saw them dragging the other day, other day
Scraping their knees

Seems the high horse is taking them all home
I can't leave myself out
Seems the high horse is taking them all home
I can't leave myself out, self out
Why should we sleep today
Why should we awake tomorrow?

We can just pop back a few and drift through this pre-programmed flight
We can just pop back a few and drift through this pre-programmed flight

Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek
Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek
This seems to be what I've needed
Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek
Across all oceans...a windy, noisy trek
The view used to be better...lands are growing into one

We wanted it this way
We were brought up to grow into one
We were brought up to grow into one

I'm going to fly up soon and seek other lands
The soothing air of flight
A bird's eye view into what I've always imagined life could be
Will it be sought after?
We might just be useless writing and ideas that laziness will corrupt in the end
Bones of dust need hardening
I think the prescription
I think the prescription is found

Sleep on
Sleep on... fly on
In your mind, you can fly
Sleep on
Sleep on... fly on
In your mind, you can fly
Sleep on
Sleep on... fly on
In your mind, you can fly
Sleep on
Sleep on...fly on
In your mind, you can fly

My teeth grin oddly today
They seem to gleam more than normal
Maybe it will be noticed
Walking dead
Walking dead
