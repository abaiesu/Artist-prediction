The wings of the parapets
Watch over the stage of joy and rage
They watch as I catch flight
And you fill the fuel to give me a ride

Here above the open ledge
With no control of which to speak
Oh, if love is a dependency
Resign me

Hear, a dove in the cargo bay
An-hundred miles beneath his feet
Oh, if love is the opposite of free
Resign me
