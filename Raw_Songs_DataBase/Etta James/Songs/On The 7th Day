I'm gonna tell you, so you'll understand
About how it all got started, how it all began
God made the heavens, God made the earth
Made a man and a woman out of blood, sweat and dirt
And he looked around the neighbourhood
And he said to himself: This is good

God made the rivers, and the mountains with his hands
God made the wind to blow the shifting sands
He put the fishes in the deep blue sea
Filled up the garden with flowers and the trees
And he looked around the neighbourhood
And he said to himself: This is Good

But the devil, he was jealous
Took the apple in his hand
The devil tempted woman, and woman tempted man
God he mourned, and the tears rolled down his face
It broke his heart to see his children fall from grace
And on the 7th day, they say God rested, but you know that ain't the truth
Cause on the 7th day, God made the blues
God made the blues

The Blues has been around ever since that day
Everybody gets the blues, everybody got to pay
For the wicked things we do, and what we put each other trough
And on the 7th day, they say God rested, but you know that ain't the truth
Cause on the 7th day, God made the blues
Cause on the 7th day, God made the blues
God made the blues
