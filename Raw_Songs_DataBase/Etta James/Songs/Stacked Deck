Well, if you gonna play cards, baby
Well, don't you know you've got to deal some time
Well, if you gonna play cards, baby
Well, don't you know you've got to deal some time
Well listen to me, baby
And I'm gonna tell you how I deal mine

The Ace is for the first time that I met you
Duce that's the second time that there was no one but just us two
Trey that's the third party, and darlin' you know his name
Four that's the fourth time that you tried to play that same old game
Five is for five years that you used me for a clown
Six that's the sixth time that you tried to put me down
Well I'm holding out for the Seven, for the seven days in the week
Well, eight that's the eighth hour, when you went out with your sheik
Nine is for the nine years that I worked hard every day
Ten that's the tenth of the month, when you came every Friday to collect my pay
Well the Jack he's your lover, and you're using me for a goat
Queen that's you pretty mama and you're trying to cut my throat
Whoa, but the King that's me, Lord and I'm about to wear my crown
So be careful pretty baby, you ain't dead when the deal goes down

If you gonna play cards, baby
Don't you know you've got to deal some time
So listen to me Baby, that you ain't dead when the deal goes down
