Without a heart, I could be so free
I wouldn't feel no pain for others' misery
Without a heart, I wouldn't care at all
If people go hungry or a soldier falls

Well, the only thing that couldn't be done
Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)

Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
I could love no one
No, no, no, no, I could love no one

I could make a lot of money
Spend it on foolish things
Pinch a penny off of poor folks
Oh, the fortune that would bring

I wouldn't be my brother's keeper
If a stranger can't get by
I wouldn't have to lift a finger
I could let a stranger die

Whoa, the only thing that couldn't be done
Is without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)

Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
I could love no one
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I could love no one

Yeah, without a heart
I couldn't love my brother and sisters
And you know, but for brother and sisters
You'll find yourself all alone without a heart

And without a heart
When that brother said, "I need a dollar, I need a dime"
You would turn your back on him
I could be so cold

I could make a lot of money
Spend it on foolish things
Pinch a penny off of poor folks
The fortune that would bring

Oh, the only thing that couldn't be done
Is without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)

Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
Oh, without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)

Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart

Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart

Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart
