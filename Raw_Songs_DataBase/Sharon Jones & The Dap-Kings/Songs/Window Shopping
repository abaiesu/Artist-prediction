You know, we walk down the street
It seems like, be with your man and
His eyes just turn every time a woman walk by
Like he just can't decide
Gonna get whiplash, looking so hard

Can't he make up his mind?
And I think I know this relationship
The same way, I don't know
I think I might be just wasting my time
But you know what, let me tell you, baby

I'm through with your window shopping, baby
I'm through waiting when you're gonna come around
I know the question isn't if you love me
But I know the answer is you'll never settle down

Oh boy, you keep window shopping
You browse around with no intent to buy
Soon you'll understand or maybe
You'll finally get it when the store close down

And I know it was never meant to be
So won't you just keep on
Keep on, keep on

Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)
Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)

You let a good thing pass you by

It hurt, I can't keep going though this
I'm not sold thinking you're right for me
Because of right now I no longer need you
But I need you to stop convincing me

And I know it wasn't meant to be
So won't you just keep on
Keep on, keep on

Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)
Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)

You let a good thing pass you by

You just keep on, keep on, keep on

Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)
Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)

You just keep on, keep on, keep on
You keep looking, keep looking
You let a good thing pass you by

You just keep on looking
You just keep on window shopping

You just keep on, keep on, keep on

You keep looking, keep looking...
