Something told me inside
That your love was untrue
Something told me inside
Something told me inside

You said, "Girl, it's alright
I would never hurt you"
You said, "Girl, it's alright"
He said, "Girl, it's alright"

Just to be by your side
I would've walked through the flames
Just to be by your side
Just to be by your side

Now it hurts me inside
Just to hear your name
Just to hear your name

I learned the hard way
That your love is cruel
I learned the hard way, baby
Not to be your fool

I learned the hard way
I learned the hard way about you
Now I know about you
Now I know about you

When I open my eyes
It was all around me
When I open my eyes
When I open my eyes

Clouds of perfume and lies
And a hotel key
Clouds of perfume and lies
Clouds of perfume and lies

And when I answered your phone
I heard a gasp and a click
When I answered your phone
When I answered your phone

Ooh, was that wrong number, wrong
Or was she after your love

Just to be by your side
I would walk through the flames
Now it hurts me inside
Just to hear your name

I learned the hard way
That your love is cruel
I learned the hard way, baby
Not to be your fool

I learned the hard way
I learned the hard way about you
Now I know about you
Now I know about you

Now I know about you
Now I know about you
Now I know about you
Now I know about you

Just to be by your side
I would walk through the flames
Now it hurts me inside
Just to hear your name

I learned the hard way
That your love is cruel
I learned the hard way, baby
Not to be your fool

I learned the hard way
Well, I learned the hard way, baby, about you
(I learned the hard way, baby)

Now I know about you
(Now I know about you)
I know about you
(Now I know about you)

Now I know about you
(Now I know about you)
Now I know about you
(Now I know about you)

Now I know about you
(Now I know about you)
I won't be your fool
(Now I know about you)

Listen, I know about you
(Now I know about you)
Your love
(Now I know about you)

I wanna go home
(Now I know about you)
I know about you
(Now I know about you)
I said, "I wanna go home"
