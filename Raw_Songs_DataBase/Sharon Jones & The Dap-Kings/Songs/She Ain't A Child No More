She'd just run when you raised a hand
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)
She was just too young then to understand
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

Came home drunk in the middle of the night
Screaming and swinging with all of your might
But a child couldn't put up a fight
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

Poor little girl she had to grow up quick
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)
Her heart's still soft, but her skin got thick
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

How could a mother be so reckless and wild?
Put your kid through such torture and trial
You could only have the love of your child
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

(She ain't a child no more)
(She ain't a child no more)

You could only have the love of your child
She ain't a child no more
She ain't a child no more

Now listen, used to think she done something wrong
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

Now her body and her mind has grown strong
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

I bet you never thought she'd grow up so tall
Stand eye to eye, toe to toe with her ma
You know you never thought she toed the law
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

She ain't a child no more
No, no, no, she ain't a child
No, no, no, she ain't a child
No, no, no, she ain't a child

No, no, no, she ain't a child
No, no, no, she ain't a child
No, no, no, she ain't a child
