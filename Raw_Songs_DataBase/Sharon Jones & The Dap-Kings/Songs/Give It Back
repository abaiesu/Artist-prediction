If I give you my love
Are you gonna give it back?
If I give you my love, tell me
Now, are you gonna give it back?

And when I give you my loving, honey
Can you handle that?
When I give you my loving, baby
Can you handle that, well?

You're on my mind
Wondering all the time
I just want to know
If you're mine

When I give my loving
Want yours in return
If not, don't you waste my time

If I give you my love
Are you gonna give it back?
When I give you just a little of my love
Now, can you handle that?

Oh baby, oh baby, can't you see
You're the only one
Make me feel so free

When I give my love
I want your love in return
If you can't give it back
Boy, don't you waste my time, ho, oh
Don't you waste my time, no, no

Are you gonna give it back, baby
Are you gonna give it back
Are you gonna give it back, yeah
Are you, I got to know you, baby

When I give you my loving, yeah
(Are you gonna give it back)
I want to know, baby
Are you gonna give it back

When I give you just a little
Little, little bit of my love
(Are you gonna give it back)
Need your love, want your love
(Are you gonna give it back)

(Are you gonna give it back)
Give it back
(Are you gonna give it back)
I gotta know, I want to feel
(Are you gonna give it back)
I wanna feel, I wanna know
(Are you gonna give it back)
