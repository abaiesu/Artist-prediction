All the way you lie to get your tales, uncle
All the things you lay to waste
But every dog has his day, uncle
And it just can't go on, it just can't go on this way
For the day will surely come
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
You're gonna pay for all you've done
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
There won't be no way to run
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
You're gonna be found out of room, yeah
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
You can bet you're gonna lose your cloud
You've been trapped in around this world
Like you're the only one livin'
But soon enough you're gonna get back
Some of what you've been givin'
The lies that you've been spinnin' up
Are runnin' out of thread
And your crafty little pencil
Is runnin' out of lead
The happy day is surely gonna come, yeah
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
Yeah, your alibis will fail you
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
Ain't nobody, nobody gonna make your bed
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
Ain't got no place to hide
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
You're gonna pay for every time you lied
Yes, you oughta be ashamed
For all you've said and done
But before the cop's around the table
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
Get yourself together
(You better pack up and run)
Oh, and pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
Get yourself together
(You better pack up and run)
Run on, run on, run on
You better pack up and run
