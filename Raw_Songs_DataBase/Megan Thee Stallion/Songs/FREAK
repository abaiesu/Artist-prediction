Oh you lookin' for a freak? I'm the biggest one
I can do a trick you ain't know make you cum
Big ghetto booty, boujee, choosey
Ain't giving up the pussy for a dinner and a movie
I need me a nasty ass nigga that don't care
Fuckin' with my ex 'cause I had the niggas scared
You ain't eating what you here for, baby I'm a nympho
Known to keep a nigga on rock like a Flinstone
Real freaks don't trip, they cum and then dip
Treat 'em like party favors, I pass 'em like chips
Get my nut, then what, I'm back to business
A good lick, hella trick that's all that he is

Suck a nigga off with Brittany in the backseat
Brand new bitch paparazzi think she Cassie
Tell her make it nasty, spit like Daffy
I ain't Billie Jean, but the bitch call me Daddy
Diamonds in my ear got me feeling like Gatsby
House full of hoes you can only imagine
5 in the morning getting ghosts like Casper
