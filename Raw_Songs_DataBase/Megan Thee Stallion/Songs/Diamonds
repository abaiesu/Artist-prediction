Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Southern girl in me
I ain't afraid to catch a case
VVS's on me and I flooded out the face

Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
I don't need you
I've got flooded out baguettes
I don't need you
Boy, my diamonds dripping wet

I'm a super shero, bitch
Don't try me hoe
Bad like a villain
I pop it and then I reload
All the best things in life come for free
But don't you think that applies to me
I do what I want 'cause I know that I'm hot
I ain't a band but you know how I rock
Don't need no clippers to give you a chop
Took me to dinner then I took him out
I like it when you call me crazy
Long as you keep callin' baby
He think it's cute that I know how to shoot
Don't you get scared if I point it at you
Broke up with my ex (Uh)
Dumped him in a text
Would wish you the best
But I already left
Date night with my bitches
Gettin' real twisted
You know what you could do?
Give my ass a bunch of kisses (Ah)

I love me this much
My pear shape all dripped up
It's freezing
In my bag (Oh)

I don't need you
I've got flooded out baguettes
I don't need you
Boy, my diamonds dripping wet (Aye)

I know how to work a gun
I don't need a range
And I can take a hit
I ain't scared of the pain
And I don't really bang
But I came with the gang
And if you get too close
I might snatch off your chain (Ooh)
You want me to be a little more lady like (Mm)
Come through with my girls and beat your ass on ladies' night (Aye)
You don't want to go toe to toe with my pedicure
Everyone you know be like, "Bro, how you handle her?"
Diamonds are my new boyfriend
So that mean I will never ever fuck with you again
And I ain't never need him so it's so easy to leave him
And I be doing me I ain't never tryin' to please him

I love me this much
My pear shape all dripped up
It's freezing
In my bag (Oh)

Look at all these rocks, rocks, rocks
They come stop and watch, watch, watch
All these diamonds dancing
Know that you can't stand this
Bands on my hands
I got bands, I'ma bandit
