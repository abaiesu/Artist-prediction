(Bikini Bottoms & Bikini Tops
You can catch Thee Stallion drinking out of Henny bottles lookin' hot, aye
Yeah, hot girl, hot girl, hot girl, hot girl)

Shades on in the party
Am I lit? Bitch of course
H-town hottie I'm the black Regina George
Ex tried to play me like a hoe
I Put him on the block and that just make him want me more
And I don't wanna talk I put my phone on DND
I'm with my other nigga tryna creep like TLC
And when he tryna start I press that button E-N-D
And only time I see him is when I'm tryna get some D
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, yeah)
I don't wanna call
I don't wanna text
Tryna set me up
Put me on the net
I don't do no pics
I don't shoot no vids
And you ain't gon see my name in no GM

I be doing me
Hanging lowkey
They gon' do the most
I'm a keep it G
I don't say a word
But I'm getting seen
Everything I do
I do it naturally

Naturally (I'm a star)
Naturally (I'm dat bitch)
Naturally (Check my fit)
Naturally (Do what I want)
Naturally (Stally)
Naturally (I'm the shit)
Everything I do

I was never meant to live life like a simp
Fuck getting skimp, I'd rather be a pimp
And every enemy I had started as a friend
They wanna see me shine
But not harder than them
So I, stepped out
Body like POW
If he runnin' with that money
You know Megan in route
Got yo Daddy drinking out the bottle
He wanna be down
Be acting like a kid
Running from your mama house
I'm sexy and we know that ain't a secret
Slick back ponytail like I'm Puerto Rican
Baby's hair on yes ma'am bitch kill it
I'm so bad I look like a super villain

I be doing me, hanging lowkey
They gon' do the most
I'm a keep it G
I don't say a word
But I'm getting seen
Everything I do
I do it naturally

Naturally (I'm a star)
Naturally (I'm dat bitch)
Naturally (Check my fit)
Naturally (Do what I want)
Naturally (Stally)
Naturally (I'm the shit)
Everything I do
I do it naturally

Hot girl

Bad bitch
Super model
Make your nigga suck my pussy like a baby bottle
Baby tryna block my blessings
I'm like AND1
And I bet your nigga is a fan, huh
He wanna ride
Cause I'm cooler than fan huh
I'm so hot
He wanna kiss on my tan line
Fine and I'm slim
I be in the gym
I know some mad hoes built like M&Ms
And a couple these dudes with these damn slim jims
Buying big magnums tryna fuck you backwards
But I like it with the lights on
I need to see if that thang really hang long
And he say imma dog
Imma need a big bone
And if you fall short
I'm a send yo ass home
Nigga take yo ass on

I be doing me
Hanging lowkey
They gon' do the most
I'm a keep it G
I don't say a word
But I'm getting seen
Everything I do
I do it naturally
