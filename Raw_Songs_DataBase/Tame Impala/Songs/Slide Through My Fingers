When I get up I've dreamt too long
Everything else is half as strong
I could see though, outside my head
They got it right, I got it wrong

I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her

Shook off her optimistic hand
I am too fixed on what I've planned
Who is the one who can't let go?
I will miss out, hell, don't I know

I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her

I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
