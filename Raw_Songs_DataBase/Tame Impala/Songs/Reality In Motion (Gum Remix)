I'm edging closer, shivers all over
It's way too real, I'm way too sober
Usually they've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, baby

It's way too real, baby
It's way too real, baby
It's way too real, baby
He said, lack of composure, baby
Carry on

I'm edging closer, shivers all over
It's way too real, I'm way too sober
Usually they've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, baby

Heading for the deep end
Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion

It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive
It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive

I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
Let's not think about it
Put your arms around me, I could sense you doubt me

You don't need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
Let's not think about it
Put your arms around me, I could sense you doubt me
You don't need to
