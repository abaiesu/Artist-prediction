Hold on and I'll think you'll like the day
Cross your heart and hope to fade away
If I was the earth, you'd be the sun, no
You'd be the entire milky way

Deep into the monsters eye
Dancing round the Daddy's thin line
We could go frolic in the meadows
We could go swimming in the serpentine

Hold on you told me you had no
This side of you never show
I wouldn't of wasted all this time
And I'd have you all to my own

Deep into the monsters eye
Dancing round the Daddy's thin line
We could go frolic in the meadows
We could go swimming in the serpentine

Oh, this feeling I've felt before
One of the visions you cannot ignore
I dunno what this feeling is for
I feel the love from you

She said it's kinda like a dream
And I said well honey I have to agree
She said my woes flow like a river
And I said they flow more the sea
