How do you feel when your baby is gone?
How can you sleep with no one to keep you warm?
You toss and turn, you cry all night
It is such a feelin', it is an awful fright

I made a mistake when I break her heart
She couldn't stand it, she decided to part
I've got to find her and apologize
I want no one, she is just my size

Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, ooh, oh
Yeah, yeah

I make a mistake when I break her heart
She couldn't stand it, she decided to part
She couldn't stand it, she decided to part
She could not stand it, she could not stand it
She could not stand, no, no, no, no, no, ooh, la la
