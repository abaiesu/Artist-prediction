I worked all summer, spring and fall
Blonde-headed woman, she's the cause of it all
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Saw her in Dallas, in El Paso
So come back baby, I need you so
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Mississippi river, so big and wide
Blonde-headed woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Mississippi river, so big and wide
Blonde-headed woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

I worked all summer, spring and fall
Blonde-headed woman was the cause of it all
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Don't come here running, holding out your hand
I have me a woman, you can grab your man
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Saw her in Dallas, in El Paso
Blonde-headed woman, you know I need you so
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Don't come here running, holding out your hand
I have me a woman, you can have your man
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Mississippi river, so big and wide
Blonde-headed woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world
