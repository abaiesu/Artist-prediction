It's the end to all my high jinx
It's the end to all my capers
Sort of a three way story
(The kind you read about in the Sunday papers)

All I was gettin' over
Havin' both cakes and eatin' them too
But to my surprise
My slice on the sun
Been eatin' the forbidden fruit

Oh, I've been cheatin' on you
I've been cheatin' on you
Been cheatin' on you with
Somebody's been cheatin' on me

Thought I was a Jimmy Slick
(Yeah, I thought that)
Don't I was a Charlie Cool
(Thought that too)
But I'm just sad and stupid
(My friends call me Freddy Poo)

Ooh dooped, why don't you call me
Turn the dooper into the doop
I'm so surprised
To find my slice on the sun
Been eatin' the forbidden fruit

Oh, I've been cheatin' on you... baby
I've been cheatin' on you
I've been cheatin' on you with
Somebody's been cheatin' on me
(Oh, somebody say something)

(Oh yeah)
(Slow that guitar)

How co-co-co-co-coo ooh dooped
Why don't you call me
Turn the dooper into the doop
I'm so surprised
To find my slice on the sun
Been eatin' the forbidden fruit

Oh, I've been cheatin' on you
I've been cheatin' on you
I've been cheatin' on you with somebody's been cheatin' on me

Baby, baby, babe
Cheatin' on you... ah ah ah
Cheatin' on you
I've been cheatin' on you with somebody's
Been cheatin' on me

Yeah baby
Cheatin' on you with somebody's
Been cheatin' on me
Come, come, come, come, come on
Cheatin' on you with somebody's
Been cheatin' on me
