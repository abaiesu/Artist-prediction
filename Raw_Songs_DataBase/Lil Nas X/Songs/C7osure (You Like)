True say, I want
And I need
To let go
Use my time, to be free
It's like it's always what you like
It's always what you like
Why it's always what you like
It's always what you like

Ain't no more acting man that forecast
Say I should just let me grow
No more red light for me baby
Only green I gotta' go
Pack my past up in the back
Oh let my future take a hold
This is what I gotta' do
Can't be regrettin' when I'm old

Brand new places I'll choose and I'll go
I know, embracing this news 
I behold unfolding
I know I know I know
I don't feel like it's time
But I'll look back at this moment
I'll see that I'm fine
I know I know I know
I don't feel like it's time
I set boundaries for myself
It's time to cross the line

Truth say, I want
And I need
To let go
Use my time, to be free
It's like it's always what you like
It's always what you like
Why it's always what you like
It's always what you like

Ain't no more acting man that forecast
Say I should just let me grow
No more red light for me baby
Only green I gotta' go
Pack my past up in the back
Oh let my future take a hold
This is what I gotta' do
Can't be regrettin' when I'm old
