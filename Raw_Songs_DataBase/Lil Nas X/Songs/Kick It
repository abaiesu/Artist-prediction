Run
To, to me
For three, see if you need weed
Get it from me, it's good
See if you want it
Nas I got it nigga, we should go and kick it
See you on the move but we was cool now don't forget it (Oh)
Come get weed from me, it's good

Now you all over the place
Check TL I see your face
You just that nigga these days
My brother show me your ways
See you on the TV, heard that billboard took your charting place
Heard your snippets on IG man tell me what's the droppin' dates
My big sister love you nigga you the goat my uncle say
New pack just came in my nigga this that cookie funnel cake

Run
To, to me
For three, see if you need weed
Get it from me, it's good
See if you want it, Nas I got it nigga
We should go and kick it
See you on the move but we was cool now don't forget it (Oh)
Come get weed from me, it's good

Oh you just that nigga now
Can't pick up cool then let me know
You ain't got no talent nigga
Mo' up in my pinky toe
I just thought that we could kick it
Why not let me know
You'll fall off I'll give it oh two months give or take a whole

Run
To, to me
For three, see if you need weed

We should go and kick it
See you on the move but we was cool now don't forget it (Oh)
Come get weed from me, it's good
