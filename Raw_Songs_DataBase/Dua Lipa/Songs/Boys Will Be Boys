It's second nature to walk home
Before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles
When there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here
Sick intuition that they taught us
So we won't freak out
We hide our figures
Doing anything to shut them out
We smile, a way to ease the tension
So it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now

When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on T.V
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

I'm sure if there's something
That I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man
Around to save the day
And that was sarcasm
In case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet

When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on T.V
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on T.V
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
