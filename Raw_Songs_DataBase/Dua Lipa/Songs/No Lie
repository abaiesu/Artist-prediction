Baby girl, you a carry ten ton a phatness,
Gimme some of that
Mixed with the badness,
Look how she hot
Shaped like goddess, but a not just that,
It's a good piece of mentals under the cap

Hot piece of frame and mi love how you trod
Watching every step of the pepper the way you got
Stayin' in my brain, memory cyah detach
Mainly my aim is to give you this love

Hypnotic the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie, baby, you
Beam me up like Scotty, baby girl
It's so hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie, baby, you
Move so hypnotic
