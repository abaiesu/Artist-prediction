Guess I never had a love like this
Hit me harder than I ever expected
We been up all goddamn night, all night, all night
Keep it going 'till we see the sunlight

And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby I could see us in the real life
You know, you know, you got

Got me losing all my cool
'Cause I'm burning up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
Got the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never running out of juice
When its only me and you
You got me, you got me losing all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer

I like us better when we're intertwined
The way you touch me got me losing my senses
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine
You got me working up an appetite, tite

And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby I could see us in the real life
You know, you know, you got

Got me losing all my cool
'Cause I'm burning up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We got the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never running out of juice
When its only me and you
You got me, you got me losing all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losing all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer

Skin tight
I'll show you heaven, there's nothing better
I'll give it to you
All night
You know, you know, you know

Got me losing all my cool
Yeah, you like the way I move
In control of what I do
And my love makes you brand new

Got me losing all my cool
'Cause I'm burning up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
Got the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never running out of juice
When its only me and you
When its only me and you

(Hey, aye, yuh)

I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losing all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losing all my cool
