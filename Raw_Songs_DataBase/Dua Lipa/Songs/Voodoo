I can't get away
Found a home in your heartbeat
I keep coming back again
There's a madness that surrounds me

And when you're a thousand miles away
I'm holding on for you
I get on my knees to pray
Cause I've fallen under you

It's your voodoo
It's your voodoo
Is this what they call love
Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo

You're my heavy rain
You drench me off of nothing
For all you gotta say
At least can you mean something

And when you're a thousand miles away
What am I supposed to do
It's strange cause your love stayed
I've fallen under you

It's your voodoo
It's your voodoo
Is this what they call love
Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo

(Voodoo, voodoo...)

Why won't you let me go
I'm under your control
Fighting to let you go
And I can't get out
Why won't you let me go
I'm under your control
Fighting to let you go
And I can't get out

It's your voodoo
It's your voodoo
Is this what they call love
Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo

(Voodoo, voodoo)
It's your voo...
(Voodoo, voodoo)
Is this what they call love
(Voodoo, voodoo)
Must be voodoo
(Voodoo, voodoo)
