Trying to find, trying to find the words to say
To show you how I don't want to spend another day without you
The words get lost they all seem to disappear
The thoughts are stuck paralyzed by this love that's here to stay

Tell me, tell me why
You're so damn good to me
It's where I start over-thinking
So is it right for me to say
You are my love
You are my love

More then fast it feels like infinity
I feeling soft ballets and symphonies
If only you could look from where I can see
See my vision on the life between me and you

Tell me, tell me why
You're so damn good to me
It's where I start over-thinking
So is it right for me to say
You are my love
You are my love
