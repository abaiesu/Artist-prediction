Have you seen Amanda Blaine in the hills of Shiloh
Wandering in the morning rain through the hills of Shiloh
Have you seen her at her door listening for the cannon's roar
And the man who went to war from the hills of Shiloh.

Have you heard her mournful cries in the hills of Shiloh
Have you seen her haunted eyes in the hills of Shiloh
Have you seen her running down searching through the sleeping town
In her yellowed wedding gown in the hills of Shiloh.

Have you seen her standing there in the hills of Shiloh
Wind a blowing through her hair in the hills of Shiloh
Listening for the sound of guns listening for the rolling drums
And the man who never comes to the hills of Shiloh.

Have you heard Amanda sing in the hills of Shiloh
Whispering to her wedding ring in the hills of Shiloh
Hear her humming soft and low poor Amanda doesn't know
It was ended forty years ago in the hills of Shiloh...
