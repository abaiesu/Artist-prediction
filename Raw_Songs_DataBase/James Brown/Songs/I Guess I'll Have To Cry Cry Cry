My cup is running over
I don't know what to do
My cup is running over
I don't know what to do
No, I don't know
No, I don't know

Guess I gotta cry, cry, cry
People, let me cry, cry, cry
I'd feel a little bit better
If I cry, cry, cry

My cup is overflowing
I don't know what to do
My cup is overflowing
I don't know what to do
No, I don't know
No, I don't know

When I, I lost you
I lost the best thing I ever had
Now that I, I realize, oh
It makes me, it makes me
It makes me so bad

My cup is running over
I don't know what to do
My cup is running over
I don't know what to do
No, I don't know
No, I don't know

Just let me cry, people
How do you feel
How do you feel
When you see a man cry

People, let me cry
I'm not ashamed
I'm not ashamed
Guess I gotta walk away now
Just let me walk away
Just let me walk away
Just let me walk away
