You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me

Sometimes I don't mind you havin' the worst day
Oh, no, I don't
All the stress turns into built-up energy
Yes, it does
On the edge, I'm your net, go on and fall back
Easy on that pressure point, I love to push that
Let your frustrations out right here
I'm your psychiatrist, let's talk about it
We can use sign language, I know your body
I see the weight weighin' on your shoulders
It's so heavy
Let me be the meaning of your composure
Oh, oh

You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might
And get it all out 'til you feel light
And take it out on me
You can take it out on me

Yeah, I'm your plug
Whatever you need, I'll make sure you get enough
And when your battery gets low
I'ma be the one to charge you up
Let me massage your mental and your physical
Whenever you lose doubt, I'll be your miracle
When you're around me, you should feel invincible
Please don't forget that

You can take it out on me, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You can take it out on me, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might (Hey)
And get it all out 'til you feel light (Ooh-oh)
And take it out on me (Oh-oh-woah)
You can take it out on me (Oh-oh-woah)
