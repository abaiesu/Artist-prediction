Choosin
Say you're choosin babe
Choosin
Say you're choosin babe
Choosin
Say you're choosin babe

All eyes on me when I walk through
Choosin
Waiting near
Choosin
On me
Choosin
All eyes on me when I walk through

Desperation, human nature
Seen you watching
We've been undressing each other
And I don't mind (choosin)
So I don't mind (choosin)
Gotta speak my mind (choosin)
Choose up one time
All eyes on me when I walk through

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah woah woah oh
Choos' choosin

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah woah woah oh
Choos' choosin

How can I help if you're good at not keeping her attention
She walked and she been in a mission
After nothing but damn right intentions (somebody)

I ain't see nothing but diamonds
They talking, she listening
Screaming and laugh from a distance
Don't be shy
Does she coming or missing
Don't doubt it

Be wise by who you calling your own
'Cause you might be left alone, that's right
This star's so bright, she can not put too far though
She get it back tomorrow

Now she's
Choosin
Say you're choosin babe
Choosin
Say you're choosin babe
Choosin
Say you're choosin babe

All eyes on me when I walk through
Choosin
Waiting near
Choosin
On me
Choosin
All eyes on me when I walk through

Desperation, human nature
Seen you watching
We've been undressing each other
And I don't mind (choosin)
So I don't mind (choosin)
Gotta speak my mind (choosin)
Choose up one time
All eyes on me when I walk through

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah woah woah oh
Choos' choosin

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah woah woah oh
Choos' choosin

When I look in your eyes
I can tell that you wanna be (tell that you wanna be)
'Cause she's making the way so she can be right in front of me (be right in front of me)

Don't pretend it and he gave your number to my friend
So don't you bring your friends come to the top floor to the penthouse girl

Desperation, human nature
Seen you watching
We've been undressing each other
And I don't mind (choosin)
So I don't mind (choosin)
Gotta speak my mind (choosin)
Choose up one time
All eyes on me when I walk through

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah woah woah oh
Choos' choosin

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah woah woah oh
Choos' choosin
