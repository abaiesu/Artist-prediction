I am not allowed to have feelings
Feelings would complicate this
I'm a stupid ugly stuttering asshole
There is no dignity in my anger

Mind if I cough in your ear all night?
Mind if I resent you for a year to night?
I am not the type of man
Who can fall asleep in someone else's arms

(Didn't mean to lie...)
I love you
Sometimes I love you
But it's hard to say
There are times when I don't love
I can't love anything in this world

I want you to know

You were disappointed and I didn't know why

Eventually it came to a head
Over something as stupid as making coffee
You said it was a mistake to ever try and help me
Then you went in the kitchen

I drove off to go buy some stuff
Which was a mistake because
I didn't want to come back
I just sat in the parking lot

And dabbed at my thumb, which was bleeding for some reason
Leaving a trail of red blossoms on the napkin
I felt sick and I didn't know what to do
How long would it be before I could face you?

The first angry song I had to hide from you
It goes like this
