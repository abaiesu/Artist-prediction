Efficiency and progress is ours once more
Now that we have the Neutron bomb
It's nice and quick and clean and gets things done
Away with excess enemy
But no less value to property
No sense in war but perfect sense at home

The sun beams down on a brand new day
No more welfare tax to pay
Unsightly slums gone up in a flashing light
Jobless millions whisked away
At last we'll have more room to play
All systems go to kill the poor tonight

Gonna kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight

Behold the sparkle of champagne
The crime rate's gone, feel free again
Oh, life's a breeze with you, Miss Lily White
Jane Fonda on the screen today
Convinced the liberals it's okay
So let's get dressed and dance away the night

While they kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight

Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight

Behold the sparkle of champagne
The crime rate's gone, feel free again
Oh, life's a breeze with you, Miss Lily White
Jane Fonda on the screen today
Convinced the liberals it's okay
So let's get dressed and dance away the night

While they kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight

Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight

Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight
