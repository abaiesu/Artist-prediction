I wish you gave me, a reason
That you were better, at leavin'
That you got your kicks from seeing me low
I always let the good ones go

Don't want the kisses, unless they're bitter
I'm hooked on touches, that leave me weaker
I swear that I love nothing more than broke
I always let the good ones go

And baby you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones, 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones

Let you down easy, I'm trying
'Cause you're everything I've spent my whole life fighting
So when I walk away, it's not your fault
I always let the good ones, go

And baby you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones, 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Yeah, yeah)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(And baby you couldn't have loved me any better, better, better)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(But doin' this is all that I've known ever, ever, ever)
I let the good ones go
