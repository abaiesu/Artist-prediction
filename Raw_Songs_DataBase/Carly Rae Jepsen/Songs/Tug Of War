You seem too good
Too good to be true
You're holding me stronger
Stronger than I'm used to

Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering who you're screwing

You seem to good
Too good to be true
I'm loving you longer
Longer than I'm used to

Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering who you're screwing

Tug of war, sweet as sin
I let go, I fell in
Feel the pull, call your name
I'm alone, once again
Tug of war, sweet as sin
I let go, I fell in
Feel the pull, call your name
I'm alone, once again

You seem too...
You seem too good
Too good to be true
You're holding me stronger
Stronger than I'm used to

Don't go out with the boys tonight (You seem too good)
I won't sleep a wink (Too good to be true)
Wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight (I'm loving you longer)
I will turn to drink (Longer than I'm used to)
Wondering who you're screwing

Tug of war (Don't go out with the boys tonight)
Sweet as sin (You seem too good)
I let go (Too good to be true)
I fell in
Feel the pull (Don't go out with the girls tonight; I'm loving you longer)
Call your name (I will turn to drink)
I'm alone
Once again (Longer than I'm used to)
Tug of war (Don't go out with the boys tonight)
Sweet as sin (You seem too good)
I let go (Too good to be true)
I fell in
Feel the pull (Don't go out with the girls tonight; you seem too good)
Call your name (I will turn to drink)
I'm alone
Once again (Too good to be true)

Tug of war, feel the pull
Tug of war, feel the pull
