Wanna say it loud and proud
Got me feelin' confident

You make my heartbeat work overtime (Work overtime)
I want your body right over mine (Right over mine)
So won't you cover me like full eclipse
Can't remember loneliness
Got me feelin' delicate
Yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)

I like to give as good as I get (Good as I get)
Don't be surprised if this is the best (This is the best)

Love the way you open mine
Sweatin' like it's summertime

And when you hear me callin' your name (Callin' your name)
It's always different never the same (Never the same)
And every morning when I wake you up
Sugar you won't need a cup
You got me feelin' confident
