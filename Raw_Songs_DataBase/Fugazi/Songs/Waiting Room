I am a patient boy

I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait

My time is water down a drain


Everybody's moving

Everybody's moving

Everything is moving,

Moving, moving, moving


Please don't leave me to remain

In the waiting room


I don't want the news

(I cannot use it)

I don't want the news

(I won't live by it)


Sitting outside of town

Everybody's always down

(Tell me why)


Because they can't get up

(Ahhh... Come on and get up)

(Come on and get up)


But I won't sit idly by

(Ahhh...)

I'm planning a big surprise

I'm gonna fight

For what I want to be


And I won't make the same mistakes

(Because I know)

Because I know how much time that wastes

(And function)

Function is the key

Inside the waiting room


I don't want the news

(I cannot use it)

I don't want the news

(I won't live by it)


Sitting outside of town

Everybody's always down

(Tell me why)


Because they can't get up

(Ahhh... Come on and get up)

Up from the waiting room


Sitting in the waiting room

(Ahhh...)

Sitting in the waiting room

(Ahhh...)

Sitting in the waiting room

(Ahhh...)

Sitting in the waiting room

(Ahhh...)


(Tell me why)

Because they can't get up
