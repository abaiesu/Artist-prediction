Cruising in the Moonlight, heading downtown
Looking for some fast love, gotta get down
Boogie Woogie woman looking my way
So, if you want a good time you know just where I stay

At the Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club

Meet me on the dance floor, let me shake my stuff
Know you aren't just players in the rock and roll game
Boogie Woogie woman join me for a dance
So if you want a good time, girl you know my plans

At the Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club

Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club
