Hmm
Hmm
Hmm

Give me your bundles of rubber
Enough wit' the rambling, get under my covers
Enough for the fam and I bundle my numbers
I crumble my bread
Come up with hundreds
I'm losing my head
Keeping the bread
Even the cheese and the reefer in reach
Keeping it iller then feverish fiends
Keeping it clean, sike
Speak of the evil and me
I'm sorta like demons and queens
I got all these people in me
Sorry my alternate ego is speakin'
People unbreathe when I get mean
Eat my fajita or get out my team
Lick up a swisher and lean
Like Evil Knievel
I beat the grime reaper
Ignite like a fever

I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene

Eat it like a cannibal
I'm not from your planet, ho
I ain't the quick fix, I'm the antidote
I get kicks out of trix but I banish hoes
Like the Hannibal
Bitches wanna bite
No mandible
Like an animal
Imbalance is in my chemicals
Get calluses from the pencil grip
Asking Alice if this is wonderland
Like Erika I don't understand
I don't understand, bitch
Twisted in the mind
I don't think that we're in Kansas
So this is what the plan is

Like a cannibal
Just like a cannibal
Like a cannibal

'Cause I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm- like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
Like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
Fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
