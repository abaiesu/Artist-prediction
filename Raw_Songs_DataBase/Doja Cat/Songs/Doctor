Heal my heart
Take my temperature, it feels so hot
Sick in love and baby, you're my doctor
Talk to me, don't be scared to go a lil' more deep
Tell you everything like you're my doctor

Yah, yah
It's the uniform, fantasy dick - unicorn
Feeling me, feeling you, head feeling warm
Head break, headaches in the Bentley
Crack kills, take a Advil when the bed shake
Steady on it, ready with it, that's a heavy dosage
Check up on it, baby watch it while he check up on it
Feeling hot, cold sweats got the fever now
Need a shot, need the cock, need to see the Doc

Give me life, please kill my pain
Numb this feeling in my veins
Boy prescribe me, I can't wait
Hypnotize me in every way

I got a PHD in the D
Put the P in the V
DC wanna see
Open up wide, say 'aah' when I ride
Take off in the day, house calls in the night
Beat it 'till the kitty sees stars in the night
Put the pussy in the ER in the night
Take one of these, twice, morning and night
And if I'm still walking you ain't tore it up right

Give me life, please kill my pain
Numb this feeling in my veins
Boy prescribe me, I can't wait
Hypnotize me in every way

Heal my heart
Take my temperature, it feels so hot
Sick in love and baby, you're my doctor
Talk to me, don't be scared to go a lil' more deep
Tell you everything like you're my doctor
Heal my heart
Take my temperature, it feels so hot
Sick in love and baby, you're my doctor
Talk to me, don't be scared to go a lil' more deep
Tell you everything like you're my doctor
