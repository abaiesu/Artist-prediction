You caught me
She getting naughty
No doubt about it
I'll be on time out
You ask me, "Girl, who yo daddy?"
I say you're mine now
You caught me
She getting naughty
No doubt about it
I'll be on time out
You ask me, "Girl, who yo daddy?"
I say you're mine now

Put me in the corner
Rock me in the bedroom
Give a girl some warning
Say it ain't no good
Put me in the corner
Rock me in the bedroom
Give a girl some warning
Say it ain't no good

Did I do that?
Oh did I do that?
Shit I put that back on a nigga like watch yo ass
Like a Siamese cat when I leave that scratch
Got a nigga like this my belt
I could take this off, I could give you hell
Have you screaming like oh my Lord
But she don't need help
No no she don't
Until she wanna talk back, talk back, talk back
Curse words, big hand, loud slap
When I come home, was good oh snap
50 shades man that's your type
Yo got me blushing man right from the back
Ain't no cursing, I swear you an ass
Freak ass nigga I swear you a track
Yall need that nigga I swear you a dad
Yo when I got him aching, he ain't taking
He gone give this ass a spanking
Don't care how high my ranking
With these rings on and I thank him
See I'm panting and those handprints
How the fuck I'm out here standing
See how the fuck I'm out here dancing
He a rough one I can't stand it ugh

You caught me
She getting naughty
No doubt about it
I'll be on time out
You ask me, "Girl, who yo daddy?"
I say you're mine now
You caught me
She getting naughty
No doubt about it
I'll be on time out
You ask me, "Girl, who yo daddy?"
I say you're mine now

Put me in the corner
Rock me in the bedroom
Give a girl some warning
Say it ain't no good
Put me in the corner
Rock me in the bedroom
Give a girl some warning
Say it ain't no good
