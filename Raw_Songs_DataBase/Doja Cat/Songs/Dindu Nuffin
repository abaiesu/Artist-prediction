How much nothing can a dindu do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to
How much money could a dindu make
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to
How much nothing can a dindu do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to

I'm a degenerate, smoke all your cannabis
You cannot handle it, wave your appendages
Tweetin' and Instagram - camera flick, bitch you was edited
Swear you'll remember this, swear you'll be camera-less
Fuck taking pictures, what's wrong with the vibe?
Might as well dead this shit, I feel alive, ugh

I feel like a part of the life
I feel like I'm starting to die
I feel like I popped in the sky
Get in my space, ha, you'll catch a rocket and ride
I spy (I spy) with my little eye a target
You mine, all of this mine
All of the shit that I buy, all of the bitches that cry
See 'em from up on the stage, see 'em from up in this cage
See 'em look down on me then I look down on they ways
Mirrorin' you
Look at myself, feelin' it too
Drunker than hell, I'm appearing in twos
Drunker than hell, I'm appearing in yous

How much nothing can a dindu, do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to
How much nothing can a dindu do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to

How much nothing could a dindu, do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
Sent you muffin like a goddamn knight
At my bake, he chef, I cook, fuck sellin'
How much, how much money could a dindu make
If a dindu, did all the things that you wish to
Shit do, I don't need a band on my wrist
Bitch niggas know about it with a pound to the fist
To the head chief, take it to the head chief
If you're making this bread chief
Take it to the head chief
Take it to the head chief
And I'm up and coming, babe, please say something like
How much nothing can a dindu, do
If a dindu, didn't do nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin

How much nothing can a dindu, do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to
How much nothing can a dindu do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to

Dindu, dindu, aye
How much money can a dindu make
If I dindu did all the thing that you wish to, hey
How much money can a dindu make
If a dindu, dindu nothin', hey
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to
