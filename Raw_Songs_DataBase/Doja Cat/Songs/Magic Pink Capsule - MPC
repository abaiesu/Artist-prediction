This will make you feel better
This will make you feel better
This could be the antidote or gateway drug
Either way baby you know it's temporary fun
And you don't have to sip none from the cup
Lick it up (tender, tender)
Tender to the touch
She still frequent fender benders
Now she slender in the butt
Chop it up more, baby
Chop it up
