Speechless

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like, like, "I love you"

Human nature

Looking out
Across the night time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the night time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why, why does he do me that way
I like livin' this way
