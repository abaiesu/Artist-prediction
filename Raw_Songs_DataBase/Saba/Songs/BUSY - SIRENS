I'm so alone-but all of my friends
But all of my friends, got some shit to do, yeah
All 'em got plans, I call 'em; "My bad," and text 'em
They never cross me like bad pedestrians
I've been this awkward since adolescence
I don't know how long I had depression
Never no peer-pressure, I'm tryna' get my little pecker off in some girl
I call my B-F-F-that ain't no secret kept, I fucked then told my cousin
I'm broke, I wasn't buzzin', I tried to hit a few years, she wasn't budgin'
I'm bogus, left my girl for some shawty, surely deservin' of all this lonely
"You sad? Tell me, how are you sad?
You got all of these friends, you got all of these fans,"
I ain't trust nobody new since 2012, I ain't let nobody in
Jesus got killed for our sins, Walter got killed for a coat
I'm tryna' cope, but it's a part of me gone and apparently I'm alone


I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh


I'm so alone, just me and my girl
She leave me for work, then leave me for school, she finally home-I leave her for tour
FaceTiming nudity, yeah
All of this new to me, yeah
All of the infidelity when I was 17 been catchin' up, it still feel like she catch me cheatin'
Niggas askin' me how tour was
Knowin' I been home like two months
And I seen your ass like two times
Save the small-talk, like, too, damn
No time, social interaction
Have female friends I found attractive
I tried to fuck, but I am no savage
Now we don't speak, we just walk past
If my past could talk-it'd probably reply to the missed calls after all
'Cause the friendships that I can't recall, done turned my heart into camouflage
While the guys I used to play basketball with doin' shit that I can't endorse
Now, with the Lord; now, when it pours down; was alone then, still alone now


I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh


I'm barely here, how I ain't present
Yeah, I drift for a second-forgot to reply to your message
But all these years
I been the same in your presence, countin' the seconds, before I reply to your message
My biggest fear (Is that I have to say goodbye)
Is that I have to say goodbye (another time) another time
So I skip town on our moment, hopefully prolonging this
I don't need nobody new to miss
I want you to know
Ooooh, ooh, ooh




Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels lay (yeah)
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels lay (yeah)
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels lay (yeah)
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels, ye

Ridin' through the city
I'm young, I'm black, I'm guilty
I know one time want to kill me
They don't know me but they fear me
Fifteen years old with the sticky
They gon' blame it on the marijuana
Hands behind your head
And they won't let up off the head
What if I move to this one state?
What if they shootin' that shit hit?
What if I run then it look bad?
Drawing they gun right off the hip
I'm probably deservin', 'cause I know they serve and protect
But they think I'm servin', or they think my cellphone's a weapon
Heard that the robber wore a black mask
I fit the description, a.k.a. nigga, what is the difference
Is it the name, we so divided I'm from Division
Clutch that purse 'cause of my dreadlocks
Cross that street 'cause I'm with my friends
Curse every song in Hip-Hop
Keep telling yourself it's a fad

Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels lay (yeah)
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels lay (yeah)
Sirens on the way, ayy

Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the-
