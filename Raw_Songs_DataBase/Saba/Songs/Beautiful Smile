Ayy, ayy, ayy
Watch it there, watch me ayy
Watch me ayy, ayy, ayy

I got a beautiful smile, honestly I forgot how
Since I put my boy in a box, sometimes I see him in the cloud
I been away for a while, I'm in the bay, in the town
Niggas debating 'bout who is the greatest
For what you debating about?

Niggas aching for clout, I know
Niggas who run in yo' house, without stakin' it out
If you ain't really 'bout, shit that you say you about
I went in a different route
I just go pivot the couch
I just envisioned the count
Then I go get that amount
I got a beautiful house, but honestly I skip the town
Anytime that the temperature down
So someone dissed me in a crew, but honestly I forgot who
'Cause niggas is snakes and what's crazy
Is that it's somebody I probably knew
Me I don't get it, no clue, that's just some shit you don't do
That's just some more shit I add to the list
That I can't give no energy to
Watch what you put up on the web
You don't want everyone aware
I just had to leave the hood
'Cause motherfuckers treated me like a celeb
I just went and cut my dreads, but I got some beautiful hair
I am just searchin' for something that's real
'Cause this shit really not what they said

I got a (Beautiful) smile, but honestly (ayy) how
I put my boy in a box, sometimes I see him in the cloud
I been away for a while, I'm in the bay, in the town
Niggas debating 'bout who is the greatest
For what you debating about?

Ayy, yeah
I swear that it's always something
Guess what? I always want something (ayy)
I swear that it's all assumption (ayy)
Here out they always want something


I got a beautiful condo
Stacking my bread for the house next
Labels keep tryin' to sign me
They do not have the amount yet
See I come from a place where them niggas don't usually amount shit
Boarded up houses across from the suburbs
That's causing a feud like the north and southern
A fight for the slavery re-cost society
Got 'em runnin' in your mother's, house (how?)
'Cause they under your covers, there's no one to cover
That's pointin' they guns as they're runnin' for cover
The news ain't gon' cover, there's nothin' to govern
When niggas keep fighting and killing each other
To deal with each other for dealin' to others
Dealin' with the facts, make a nigga wonder
Who gon' have my back when the storm thunder
He gon' take the white, cook and make it butter
Ain't no thinking twice, he don't ever stutter
Money in his sight, runnin' to them numbers
That's the finish line, right before he crosses blue and red lights
Central booking cover 25 to life
Something like his cousin, that's the way of life
Nothing's ever promised but I got a-


I got a beautiful smile, honestly I forgot how
Since I put my boy in a box, sometimes I see him in the cloud
I been away for a while, I'm in the bay, in the town
Niggas debating 'bout who is the greatest

Ayy, yeah
I swear that it's always something
Guess what? I always want something (ayy)
