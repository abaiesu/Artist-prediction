Ah
Ay, yeah

All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet
Got this shit down to a science
Yeah, I get so excited
I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous
Yeah, I get so excited
All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet
Got this shit down to a science
Yeah, I get so excited
I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous
Yeah, I get so excited

I be on the road
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait
I said I be on the road
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait

Ayy, ayy, look
Heard your shit, it is not fire
New shit coming like a tidal wave
Been in that booth like five whole days
Chicago survival rate
I'mma keep it jazz like Johnny 'Trane
Y'all niggas countin' everybodies lane
Saba like  oh my god, ay
But I drop hits like Johnny Cage
Stage dive nigga, no shirt, red alert
And I'm from the same city, like Dirk, can't revert
To the same shit that make a baby burp
All gas, no brakes if I do I'll wanna skrr
Her favorite rapper Cardi so she told me "Okurr!"
And if I'm at a party then I'm first
I don't wanna judge, no this is not church
But if she wanna touch, the decision's hers
I may dance on another planet, Richard Branson

All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet
Got this shit down to a science
Yeah, I get so excited
I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous
Yeah, I get so excited

I be on the road
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait
I said I be on the road
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait
