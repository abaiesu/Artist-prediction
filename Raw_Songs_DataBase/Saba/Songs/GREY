The best song is probably on the B-Side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
This so grey-grey
The best song is probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine-grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest in the game-grey

Sometimes I think about the pressures of a artist
And what it takes to be called a
Success, even with no college we barely even considered
Don't label me with them niggas
Infatuation with plastic, I wanted it to be realer
First they wanted the hip-hop
Then they wanted guerilla and then they wanted drug dealer
And then they wanted a dancer
Now they want a drug addict, infatuation with plastic
White girl want to be sister
Driver want to be walker and walker want to be sitter

The best song is probably on the B-Side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
This so grey-grey
The best song is probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine-grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest in the game-grey

Sometimes I think about the pressures of the label
And what it take to get paid for discoverin' art, they ain't no
Existin', I know it ain't yo, intention to try and change me
Multi-million, your children, private school, they attendin'
And album sellin' what did it, I shuck and jive, a good nigga
Split the pot and I'm silent
I'ma give you your single and you just give me the finance
"Saba, if it's so bad then, hey why the hell are they signin'?"
'Cause sitter want to be walker and walker want to be drivin'

The best song is probably on the B-Side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
This so grey-grey
The best song is probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine-grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest in the game-grey

Care for me, carefully, back with more clarity
Back like consecutive, I told you motherfuckers like Oedipus
Heather B, Sway in the Morning, painter that paint like a portrait
Action, I aim for the target, aim for the fame but the fortune cool
Alterin' the altitude, offerin' the thought for food
Offerin' that art that move, hmm
Carefully editing every word, everything got to be charity
Give it my all, these melodies therapy
I keep it thoroughly PIVOT the legacy
How could you not be moved? I don't give them an option to
Don't nobody want to be great, everybody want to be seen
And nobody want to be quiet, everything is
Everything is, everything is, everything is
Care for me, carefully, back with more clarity
Back like consecutive, I told you m- look
Everything is grey, everything is grey
Everything is grey, everything
