Yellin' at my mother like, "I know you hear me"
Get a little closer, repeat, bus driver pass me up, don't see me
Paramedics talk about what he need, he need his oxygen
They seem incompetent, I see the consequence
I walk when I can't hear them, they're inaudible
I got a light I gotta go, forensics search for follicle
I promise y'all I'm not a ghost, I promise y'all

Look, there's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around
No, I can't feel pain but I can see the stars
I ain't leave in vain but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around
No, I can't feel pain but I can see the stars
No, I ain't leave in vain but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven

Yellin' at my brothers like, "I know that I'm here"
Regardless how loud, they don't hear
Walkin' through the crowd, they share tears
I know I did not disappear
Uphill I'm battlin', I see the cameraman
I see the new station's truck parked outside, it's every channel here
Yeah, interview, interview, interview, cut
Someone just bled out because they got (What?!)
Chalk outline look like the shape of my shadow
Can go right through the wall if I try touch

There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven, heaven, heaven
No, I can't feel pain but I can see the stars
I ain't leave in vain but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around
No, I can't feel pain but I can see the stars
No, I ain't leave in vain but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven
