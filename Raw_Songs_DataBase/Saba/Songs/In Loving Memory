Turn a obstacle obsolete
Turn a cheek, poverty, heritage, cotton seed
I could be lotta things, lottery winner
This album autobiography, I feel like Socrates
Hypothesis: opposites attract
Squares around the block again, Turn a obstacle obsolete
I believe I can fly, "R Kelly", awkwardly
Ain't really popular, prolly 'cause, they all doubted but I was up while they slept
While they said I wouldn't amount to much, I was hit
I knew that if I ain't older, I turn a obstacle obsolete
Up the street where they bang, I ain't hang
Out the jam, wap da bam, I'll pretend all our friends still alive
Still apply for the fall, cap and gown, for the fail
Furthermore, first of all, curtain call, shirt and tie, I'm a paul... bearer
Turn a obstacle course to a porket, weigh out a horse in a carriage that wasn't in your inheritance
Splitting parts as we jumpin' offa the porch again
Portuguese, we don't speaks it but poetry hopelessly hope the Lord'll see when our dreams get... torn apart
On the tar, left the kid, on your mark
Joan of Arc, genocide, second time, Noah's Ark
Now you're dead, no one saw

When I'm dead, and I'm gone
Would you smile, cause you know
Where I've been, and gone?
When you're dead, and you're gone
Would I smile, cause I know
Where you've been?
When I'm dead, and I'm gone
Would you smile, cause you know
Where I've been, and gone?
When you're dead, and you're gone
Would I smile...

"My name's Will Fountain...
Three things off my bucket list:
One, I wanna have a meal from In-N-Out, 'cause I live nowhere near one
Two, I wanna go one on one against D. Rose
And three, I wanna fuck Kylie Jenner"
