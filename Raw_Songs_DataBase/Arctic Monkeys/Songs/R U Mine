I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island,
Time-traveling diamond
Cutter shaped heartaches
Come to find you
Four in some velvet morning
Years too late
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

I guess what I'm trying to say
Is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting,
Wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere
Misbehaving for days
Great escape
Lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (are you mine? Mine?)

And the thrill of the chase
Moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken,
I just wanna hear you say
"You got me, baby. Are you mine?"

She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow, or just mine tonight?)
