Last night when my psyche's subcommittee sang to me in it's scary voice
You slowly dropped your eyelids
When true love takes a grip it leaves you without a choice

And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit sometimes I fantasize about you too

The leader of the free world reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
He's got himself a theme tune
They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit sometimes I fantasize about you too

In the daytime, bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies
Summat else to publicise
I'm sure you've heard about enough

So in response to what you whispered in my ear
I'll be upfront, sometimes I fantasize about you too
