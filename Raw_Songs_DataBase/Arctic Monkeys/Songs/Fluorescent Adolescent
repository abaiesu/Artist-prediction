You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis

Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem,
My love, when you dream them up...

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it

Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem,
My love, when you dream them up

Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go? Whoa.

Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again.

you're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
We're just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again

You used to get it in your fishnets
(falling about)
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
(you took a left off Last Laugh Lane)
Landed in a very common crisis

Everything's in order in a black hole
(we're sounding it out)
Everything was pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
(but you're not coming back again)
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
