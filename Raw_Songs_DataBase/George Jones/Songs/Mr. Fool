I've got a feeling you'll soon be leaving
But I won't beg you not to go
Because I've always been
A fool to cry for you

I know this time it's really over
For there's no happiness in store
And I will never be the fool I was before
No one can ever call me Mr. Fool no more

My tears were scattered with all was shattered
Dreams that faded in the past
Vows were spoken and vows were broken
But the last one was the last

So I'll keep smiling although you're leaving
For time will heal a heart that's sore
And I will never be the fool I was before
No one can ever call me Mr. Fool no more

So I'll keep smiling although you're leaving
For time will heal a heart that's sore
And I will never be the fool I was before
No one can ever call me Mr. Fool no more
