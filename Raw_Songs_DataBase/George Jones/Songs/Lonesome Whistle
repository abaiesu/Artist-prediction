I was ridin' No 9 headin' south from Caroline
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
Got in trouble had to roam I left my gal and left my home
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow.

Just a kid acting smart I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off that Georgia Main locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow.

All alone I bear the shame, I'm a number not a name
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry when the evening train goes by
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow.

I'll be locked here in this cell till my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that gal of mine, I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow...
