Your halo is the neon
Your heart a jukebox song
Your heaven is a honky tonk
You love to live so wrong.

I know your not a changin'
As a saint you've gained no fame
My angels kinda tarnished
But I love, just the same.

Tarnished angel 
From a backstreet bar
Tarnished angel
I want you just as you are.

Our worlds are strange and different
But love they says is blind
I'll try to live in your world
If you won't live in mine.

Tarnished angel 
From a backstreet bar
Tarnished angel 
I want you just as you are.

Our worlds are strangely different
But love they say is blind
I'll try to live in your world
If you won't live in mine...
