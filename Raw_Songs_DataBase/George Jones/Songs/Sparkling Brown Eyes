There's a rambleshackle shack
Down in old Caroline
It keeps a callin' me back
To that gal of mine.

Yeah, If I had the wings
Of a beautiful dove
Yes, you know I'd fly away
To the gal that I love.

Those two brown eyes
That sparkle with love
Shines down to me
From Heaven above.

Well, If I had the wings
Of a beautiful dove
Yes, you know I'd fly away
To the gal that I love.

When the whippoorwills call
On the hill far away
We'll, you could sing a love song
It's gonna help me to say.

My love for you
Ain't gonna never, never die.
Yes, I'd rather sing a song
Everyday that I die.
