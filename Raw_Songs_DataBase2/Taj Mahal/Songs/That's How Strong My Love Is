If I were the sun way up there
I'd go with love almost anywhere
I'll be the moon when the sun goes down
Just to let you know I'm still around
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is

I'll be the weeping willow drowning in my tear
You can go swimming when you are here
And I'll be the rainbow after the tears are gone
Wrap you in my colors and keep you warm

That's how strong my love is, darling
That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is

I'll be the ocean so deep, deep and wide
Catch the tears whenever you cry
I'll be the breeze after the storm has gone
To dry your eyes and love you warm

That's how strong my love is

That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is

That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
So much of loving, so much
So much, so much of loving

That's how strong my love is, c'mon
That's how strong my love is, be young
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
