My Grandfather married one fine St. Kitts woman
My Grandfather married one fine St. Kitts woman
She would come to our house and make on the stove some of those peppermint patties
Putting sugar in our beer call it tay-la-sang tooley why-a-cake-it from me
You know that my Grandfather married one fine St. Kitts woman
She would hold you, love you, and scold you
Making sure she told you everything she could feel

And now I feel that Spirit
Deep down in my Soul
Make me think back to my ancestors
Who lived a long time ago
Who lived a long time ago

When I feel that spirit
Deep down in my Soul
Make me think of some ancestors
Who lived a long time ago
Ruled the world and all its gold

For that my Grandfather married one St. Kitts woman
My Grandfather married one fine St. Kitts woman
She would come lifting with her voice to the house
Making peppermint patties
Taking toknit put some sugar in I beer lie lutill juna taki from me

You know that my Grandfather married one fine St. Kitts woman
She would hold you, love you, and scold you
Making sure she told you they will never know what it is you need

When you here that Spirit
Chuck it to me chuck it
Moving in your Soul
Its a message from an ancestor who lived a long time ago
Ruled the world and all its gold

I say when you feel that Spirit child
Moving in your Soul
Its a message from an ancestor who lived a long time ago
