I've always come to the conclusion
That 'but' is the way
Of asking for permission
To lay something heavy on one's head

So I have tried to not be the one
Who 'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside
I think you should know

And baby that's you, you, you made life's history
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

I've always felt that
Tomorrow is for those
Who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday
And start living for today

I feel that lasting
Moments are coming
Far and few between
So I should tell you
Of the happiness that you bring

Baby, baby, it's you, you, you made life's history
Oh baby, you've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

You've brought some joy inside my tears
You've brought some joy inside my tears

You've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, baby, you have done what no one thought could be
Hey, you've brought some joy inside my tears

Gotta tell you, you, you, you made life's history
You've brought some joy inside my tears
You've brought, you've brought, you've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, baby, baby, you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

You made it, baby, you made it, baby, made it, made life's history
You, you, you made life's history
You've brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
Nobody ever thought it would be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

You, you, you made life's history
You have made
Gotta shout about it, baby
You've brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

Oh, baby, you, you, you made life's history
You've brought some joy inside my tears

You've brought some joy inside my tears
Ah, ah, baby
You've brought some joy inside my tears
