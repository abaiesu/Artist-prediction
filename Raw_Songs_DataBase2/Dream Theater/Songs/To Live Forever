If I'd started from the top
And worked my way down
There'd be no reason
To live forever
To live forever

The starvation has turned
Me outside in
And the wind has blown
Me halfway across the world
Across the world, yeah

Why was I born?
In an age of distrust
I'd offered some change
For a photograph
It will always stay the same
You will always be the same

Until I show a desire for revenge
My hunger will waste me to sleep
As long as I have to die in the attempt
Then there is no reason
To live forever

I found you where, they left you there
A passing word that's gone forever
And searching my memory for answers
I saw the words of a letter you wrote

She said, "You don't have to live forever
You don't wanna live forever"
And everything's changing now
I don't want to live forever
