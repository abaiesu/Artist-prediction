Album: Deceivers

// Handshake With Hell //

Collective consciousness
Synapses between us
We pierce the sky with fists
We shroud the Earth in dust

Bow, sit down, take a knee
Before powers that be
We're here to spread the flame
Welcome to the game

And after all is said and done
Since the moon eclipsed the sun
Can you feel the wrath of truth?
Does it burn you like abuse?

Come along to the killing grounds
It's execution day
The grip of a thousand hands
Squeezes the life from supremacy

And after all is said and done
When the dark delays the dawn
Walk your path towards the reaper
Learn that hell is other people

Obey
As we
Decay
Buy me a lobotomy

Fools never cease to amaze
Keep digging your grave
A lobotomy

Down here for eternity
Where fire and ice meet
You burnt the world above
We rule the world beneath

And after all is said and done
Before a new day has begun
Bid your worries all goodbye
Flee the pan into the fire

Obey
As we
Decay
Buy me a lobotomy

Fools never cease to amaze
Keep digging your grave
A lobotomy

Fool me once and I'm numb
Twice and I'm dumb
Thrice, I won't be fooled again

Fool me once and I'm done
Twice I succumb
To a handshake with hell

In the end, we only reap what we have sown
Can't leave well enough alone
The world's at stake
Under an oath that cannot break

Obey
As we
Decay
Buy me a lobotomy

Fools never cease to complain
Keep digging your grave
A lobotomy

// Deceiver, Deceiver //

Secrets whispered through a veil of lies
When did I become this person you despise?

Open my eyes
You've been in disguise
The door is closing
You're on the outside now
It's curtain call

After everything I did for you
This is what you choose to put me through?
What happened to the concept of loyalty?
I guess there really is no more honesty!

Open my eyes
You've been in disguise
The door is closing
You're on the outside now
It's curtain
It's curtain call

Deceiver, deceiver
My head still spinning from your Judas kiss
Deceiver, deceiver
Not one thing about you I will miss

You put on a great act, I'll give you that
Go on and take a bow you despicable rat
Accept the applause, you king of whores
This is your grand finale

Deceiver, deceiver
My head still spinning from your Judas kiss
Imposter, I see you
Thou beest slain, tyrant, show thy face!

Open my eyes
You've been in disguise
The door is closing
You're on the outside now
It's curtain call
It's curtain call

Deceiver, deceiver
I see... you!

// In The Eye Of The Storm //

The chase is on, the traps are set
Won't let them drag me back there again
The ball on that chain, it bears my name
To tame the beast in me
I still believe in life before death
It fuels the fire in me

I will run 'til I die
Under these black skies
Tyrannic law, a razor claw
In the eye of the storm

As darkness falls the hunt goes on
The hounds of hell have picked up my scent
The rain pours down, I'm still running
My breath freezing the air
We may be born to astride the grave
But I will not die a slave!

I will run 'til I die
Under these black skies
Tyrannic law, a razor claw
In the eye of the storm

Under these black skies
In the eye of the storm

I will run 'til I die
Under these black skies
Tyrannic law, a razor claw
In the eye of the storm

I will run 'til I die
Under these black skies
Tyrannic law, a razor claw
In the eye of the storm

// The Watcher //

Born to a flock of animosity
To be judged, to be shamed, no rights and no dignity
Beneath the eye of disdain
Where the watcher sees the wicked, we compel

Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy daughters of death
Gripping the face of the earth
Return to dirt
Under the eye

Don't fear the watcher, sentinel from the skies above
The rebel angel sees through all of us
Beware the watcher, the earth is erased in flood
The rebel angel laughs and falls at last

Does the observer make reality?
Does the gaze activate quantum complicity?
Beneath the pyre and pain
Where we jettison body and brain!

Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy daughters of death
Gripping the face of the earth
Return to dirt
Under the eye

Don't fear the watcher, sentinel from the skies above
The rebel angel sees through all of us
Beware the watcher, the earth is erased in flood
The rebel angel laughs and falls at last
At last

Writhing with the Nephilim
Behold fire and flood!

Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy daughters of death
Gripping the face of the earth
Return to dirt
Under the eye

Don't fear the watcher, sentinel from the skies above
The rebel angel sees through all of us
Beware the watcher, the earth is erased in flood
The rebel angel laughs and falls at last
At last

// Poisoned Arrow //

Silent shadows, a broken frame
The empty picture that we became
No words needed, the stories in our eyes
A crack in the mirror, too many lies

Deep footsteps mark the snow
Traces of yesterday, where and when to go
We never meant to cause pain nor sorrow
Now every word a poisoned arrow

Is it worth fighting for?
Or even dying for?
Broken, yet unspoken
The feeling is gone

Hostile words and heavy hearts
This is where our paths drift apart
No more anger, no more sadness
Turn the page, another poisoned arrow

Is it worth fighting for?
Or even dying for?
Broken, yet unspoken
The feeling is gone

Is it worth fighting for?
Is it worth dying for?
The feeling is gone

(Is it worth fighting for?)
(Is it worth dying for?)

Is it worth fighting for?
Or even dying for?
Broken, yet unspoken
The feeling is gone

Is it worth fighting for?
(No)
Is it worth dying for?
The feeling is gone

// Sunset Over The Empire //

Welcome to the apocalypse, the end of days
Rulers of the wasteland, rejoice in the flames
Futures tumble, legacies crumble
Thousands of years and what have we learned?

They heard the warnings, ignored the signs
Wheels of injustice kept on turning
Unaccountable for their crimes
On the streets anger burning

Black clouds rumble, dark days ahead
As the chorus chants for a holy war

"It's the end of an era, a new dawn will rise"

Words turned to war, brother fighting brother
Another false truce, as the people die
The fate of the nation forever changed
Behold - the fiery end is nigh
Behind closed doors, corruption wins
The power echelon prepares their task
One step forward, two stabs in the back
Revolution is a mere change of masks?

Black clouds rumble, dark days ahead
As the chorus chants for a holy war

"It's the end of an era, a new dawn will rise"

We rise again from the stench and the pain
We pass through fire, darkness erase the stain

Black clouds rumble, dark days ahead
As the chorus chants for a holy war

"It's the end of an era, a new dawn will rise"
"It's the end of an era, a new dawn"

As the sun sets on the empire
Is there a future to be found?
Hopes and dreams... now ashes on the ground

// House Of Mirrors //

See the choice, it lies before you
A simple flick of the wrist
Blank doors keep the world at bay
Or do they keep the outside in?
What geometry lies beyond?
A familiar façade, keys in locks

Unhinge the future
Shut out the past
Winners and losers
Fiction and fact

Renegade are reflections made across a sharpened blade
In a house of mirrors, you're never alone
Welcome home!

To open is to invite the unknown
In to flood your once square home
The walls silently watch you
Are you watching them back?
Windows to the souls surround you
What escapes when those panes crack?

Unhinge the future
Shut out the past
Winners and losers
Fiction and fact

Renegade are reflections made across a sharpened blade
In a house of mirrors, you're never alone
Welcome home!
Suspicious simulacra distort your flesh and bone
'Cause in a house of mirrors, you're never alone
Welcome home!

You'll run
You'll hide
Or try to

But we all
Reside
Inside you

Renegade are reflections made across a sharpened blade
In a house of mirrors, you're never alone
Welcome home!
Suspicious simulacra distort your flesh and bone
'Cause in a house of mirrors, you're never alone
Welcome home!

// Spreading Black Wings //

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Cast from heaven, now to rule in hell
A cry for freedom in a long lost tale
Darkness is all around me
Or is it all within me?
Tired of living on my knees
Can I be set free, be the real me?
I can't breathe, I can't see
I can't touch, I can't feel

Oh, morning star
Son of the dawn
Fallen from grace
Do not fear to tread
The left-hand path
I am here
Spreading black wings

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Opened my eyes, saw the divine lies
The power lies within me
Not in worship of idols
I am my own authority
Break the chains of past
Sweet freedom at last
I can breathe, I can see
I can touch, I can feel!

Oh, morning star
Son of the dawn
Fallen from grace
Do not fear to tread
The left-hand path
I am here
Spreading black wings

// One Last Time //

Life's been a losing game, every day the same
An impossible dream, a cog in the machine
If I don't make it now, don't think I ever will
So, what now?

Frustration
Stagnation
Don't dream too big, you might hurt yourself
Just stay in line

Determination
Ooh, confrontation
I'm on my way
Heading into the unknown

Patience is running out
It's wearing thin
Feels like I'm slipping
Losing ground

I'm gonna break free
Get out of these chains
I've got nothing to lose
And everything to gain
The future is calling
It's calling out my name
One last time

Running out of breath, on this spinning wheel
Make it real, all will be revealed
Too many missing pieces to this puzzle
I've played their game, but it's not who I am
No

Frustration
Stagnation
Don't dream too big, you might hurt yourself
Just stay in line

Determination
Ooh, confrontation
I'm on my way
Heading into the unknown

Patience is running out
It's wearing thin
Feels like I'm slipping
Losing ground

I'm gonna break free
Get out of these chains
I've got nothing to lose
And everything to gain
The future is calling
It's calling out my name
One last time

I'm gonna break free
Get out of these chains
I've got nothing to lose
And everything to gain
The future is calling
It's calling out my name
One last time

// Exiled From Earth //

We're standing face-to-face
With a century of mistakes
Our coup de grâce, our exodus
Embers, coal and rust

We'll never
We'll never learn
This time there's no return

Now we are nomads
With nowhere to go
Exiled from earth
Racing extinction
Sapiens' deathblow
Once kings, now cursed

Folded time to meet our end
Murdered our only home
Too proud to comprehend
Now Gaia reclaims her throne

We are all
We're all condemned
Back into the primordial soup, we descend

Now we are nomads
With nowhere to go
Exiled from earth
Racing extinction
Sapiens' deathblow
Once kings
Once kings, now cursed

Now we are nomads
With nowhere to go
Exiled from earth
Racing extinction
Sapiens' deathblow
Once kings
Once kings, now cursed

// Into The Pit //

Bear witness to treason
Abeyance they cower
Compulsion of liars
Addicted to power

Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit

Conspiring for sation
Malfeasance on high
Obstruction of duty
Disorder will rise

Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit

Possession by force
Reprisal to task
Defenseless no longer
Expulsion by mass

Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit

// Diamond Dreamer //

Day and night all alone
I'm sure I'm gonna make it on my own
I know it's real I've got a dream
No matter how hard or far it may seem

Diamond dreamer you're not a loser
Diamond dreamer you're gonna win

Set the day you'll be the champion
Find out things that have to be done
Throw your minor tears away
Happiness will take you to that day

Don't be afraid to be a dreamer
Can you feel the action in the air
You got to fight and never stop
All the way you need to reach the top
