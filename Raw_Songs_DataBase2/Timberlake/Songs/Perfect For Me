I know your favorite song
I hear it everyday
Whoever made your smile
Made it to get in my way
And every time you laugh
You make that little sound
It's just the hardest thing
To love you but not know how

So I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid
'Cause I've tried to forget you but these things just don't go away

I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
If I didn't know better then I would believe
We were made for each other
But I'd know the truth
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me

What good are words when they always just get in our way
And it hurts the most just to know that you don't feel the same, the same
So sometimes I get down on my knees and I pray things will change
But life is what happens when things they don't work out our way, our way

So I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid
'Cause I've tried to forget you but these things just don't go away, away

I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
If I didn't know better then I would believe
We were made for each other
But I'd know the truth
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
