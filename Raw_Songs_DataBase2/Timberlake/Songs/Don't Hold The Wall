Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Dance, dance, don't hold the wall
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall


Come on the floor with them legs,
Was getting down but I get up,
Cause I heard you tell your girlfriend that I deserve better,
Hmph well, I think you look better
But you're so far, I had to come get ya'

Take you to the light,
It's dark in the back
You started moving,
You put a arch in your back
Closer to me, closer to me
Sippin' your drink,
And you're getting closer to me
Dance in the light,
Starting to see,
You started moving,
You're getting closer to me
And now you won't even let me go


So baby hold up,
Dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Baby hold up,
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't hold the wall.


Dance, (You really turn me on)
Dance, don't, don't, don't, hold the wall
Dance, dance, (You really turn me on)
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall


Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Dance, dance, don't hold the wall
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall

I think I heard what you said
He's not what you thought and you're fed up
I heard your girlfriend tell you, you could do better,
Well, hmph, I'm the best ever
But you're so far, I had to come get ya'

Take you to the light,
It's dark in the back
You started moving,
You put a arch in your back
Closer to me, closer to me
Sippin' your drink,
And you're getting closer to me
Dance in the light,
Starting to see,
You started moving,
You're getting closer to me
And now you won't even let me go


So baby hold up,
Dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Baby hold up,
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't hold the wall.


Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't hold the wall


So baby hold up,
Dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Baby hold up,
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't hold the wall.


C'mon and dance,
C'mon baby dance with me
Take my hand,
Get on the floor

Please don't hold the wall
Please don't hold the wall tonight
We're gonna do it all,
So please don't hold the wall tonight


C'mon and dance,
