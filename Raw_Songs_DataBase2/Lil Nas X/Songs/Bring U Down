I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down

I'm looking at you and I got a trick up my sleeve
And yes I'm peeping your secrets so you get ready to leave
The media's calling oh baby that's TMZ
I'm telling your secrets so best get ready to grieve

I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down

I dug up your past and now I know all of your moves
And I got witnesses, statements 
And I got all of the proof
I'm wondering 'bout you 
Because I got nothing to do
I notice you're winning 
And I got nothing to lose

I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down

I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
