I don't wanna move

I'll just sit here in my living room

And see what's on the tube

While I'm hanging out with you


People knock on my door

Ringing my phone

Telling me the things I gotta get done today

To satisfy them, but what about me?

Lately I've been wishing I was brain dead

No responsibilities in my head today

Baby let's see what's on the TV


Doing nothing having fun

off to bed to get things done

I'm not lazy, I'm in love

I don't wanna move

I'll just sit here in my living room

And see what's on the tube

While I'm hanging out with you


People pressing my flesh

Taking my time

They don't know a thing about my life with you

I'm trying real hard

Hard not to care

Cause all I ever really want to do

Is sit around doing nothing with you

Because nothing's only fun when you're there


"Mad About You" at dinnertime

"Seinfeld", "Simpsons", "So-Called Life"

Seen the reruns 20 million times


I don't wanna move

I'll just sit here in my living room

And see what's on the tube

While I'm hanging out with you


all I wanna do is just sit here in my living room

And see what's on the tube

While I'm hanging out with you


All I wanna do

All I wanna do

All I wanna do

Is do nothing with you


All I wanna do

All I wanna do

All I wanna do

Is do nothing with you
