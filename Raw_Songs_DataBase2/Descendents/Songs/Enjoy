Flatulation punctuates the still night air

And I thank god you're here


I queefed - Enjoy

Make the most of my butt-toast

Enjoy my good friends - Enjoy


The laces of my shoes unlock the mystery

Come and share a treat with me

I can't recall the last time I washed my feet

We're in for a treat


Here's my shoes - Enjoy

And here's my socks - Enjoy

Make the most of my toe toast

Enjoy, my good friends - Enjoy


Flatulation punctuates the still night air

And I thank God you're here


I queefed - Enjoy

Smell my feces - Enjoy

Sniff my ass whilst I pass gas

Enjoy my good friends - Enjoy
