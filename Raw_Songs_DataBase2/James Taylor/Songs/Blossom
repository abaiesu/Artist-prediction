Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way lately, I've been lonesome.
Blossom, it's been much too long a day, seems my dreams have frozen, melt my cares away.

Send the sunshine down my way whenever you call my name,
I know what you mean to say to me, girl, it's all the same.

Blossom, there's any empty road behind, sit you down beside me.
Blossom, there's a sweet dream on my mind, there's a song inside me, take these chains away.

Now, send the sunshine down my way whenever you call my name,
I know what you mean to say to me, girl, it's all the same.

Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way lately, I've been lonesome.
Blossom, it's been much too long a day, seems my dreams have frozen, melt my cares away.
La la la la la la la...
