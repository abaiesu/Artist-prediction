Your look will always find me hypnotized
Behind every cloud there's a silver lining
There's a pain in my heart
Is it for real or on show
Let's try to just make a point
Let's try to get to the point
You worry too much kid
About how to say it
You worry too much kid
About how to say it
Who's got the time to hang on?
Nobody, anymore
Who's got the time to hang on?
Nobody, anymore
For every star that shines at night
Another hope won't burn as bright
Is there a question to answer?
When only darkness lies in sight
Think of my arms to hold you tight
Let's try to get to the point
You worry too much kid
About how to say it
You worry too much kid
About how to say it
Who's got the time to hang on?
Nobody, anymore
Who's got the time to hang on?
Nobody, anymore
Your look will always find me hypnotized
