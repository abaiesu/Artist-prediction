Did you realize or you can't remember?
Well, adjust your eyes and let 'em clear
But if you ain't alright
Well, just remember
I'm on your side

I'm on your side
Through thick and thin and any line
We'll cross divides and we will stand in hope and light
But if you ain't all right, just remember
I'm on your side

Came into the light and it felt like thunder
But in your eyes, it just appears
You're dug in tight
In your opinion, there's just two sides
It won't align in a capsized culture
Leaned in the right and then it veered
And in its time, is it wonder or is it fear?

I'm on your side
Through thick and thin and any line
We'll cross divides and we will stand in hope and light
But if you ain't all right, just remember
I'm on your side

Now there's a chance to see if we just open up our eyes
And if you can't believe, come on, please just try

But if you ain't all right, just remember
I'm on your side
But if you ain't all right, just remember
I'm on your side
