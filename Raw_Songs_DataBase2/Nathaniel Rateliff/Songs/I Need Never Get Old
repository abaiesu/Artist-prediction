Can we be there
Oh just think of the time
Thought of love so strange
Said you never knew
While I try my best
To cover our eyes
It's a common way to blame and hide the truth

I know that some will say
It matters but little babe
Ah but come on and mean it to me
I need it so bad

I needed to try
Needed to fall
I needed your love I'm burning away
I need never get old

Taking our time
Ah just standing in the rain
Meaning what you said
Ah and mean it to me
All of these lies
Oh and never again
Come on and say it now say it's a game

I know that some will say
It matters but little babe
Ah but come on and mean it to me
I need it so bad
Ah mean it to me
I need it so bad

I needed to try
Needed to fall
I needed your love I'm burning away
I need never get old

I said I needed to try
Needed to fall
I needed your love I'm burning away
I need never get old

I said I needed to try
Needed to fall now baby
I needed your love I'm burning away
I need never get old

I need never get old
I need never get old
I need never get old
I need never get old
