Fuck!
Yo

They be like your highness
Why you always buying' that fly shit?
Why you gotta check them tyrants?
And why you shut it down like hydrants?
Four door or five six
See what we get with that mind set
Now what's priceless?
When it's nice lenses on my iris
Need a high check for that white jet to my island
Why she gotta swag like a light bitch?
Why she gotta brag like a tight bitch?
Why she gotta act like a white bitch?
Cause I don't respond to your hype shit?
I think that you niggas might like this
Like, is the world for me?
Do you ever feel like that?
Like life is surreal but you gotta keep it real like that
Sometimes you gotta split real fast
Turn down these niggas that they heels go clack, clack, click, clack
He ain't had an ass, this, bad
Only if you bad then you more like Cat
We just stack we don't fold our cash
Doja you ain't a British bitch
Shit I just like British kids
Do you mind if I twist my hips and dutty wine on your bitches lips?
I'm cuntified and I killed this shit
I'm done let the DJ spin this hit
Yup, yup, yup
