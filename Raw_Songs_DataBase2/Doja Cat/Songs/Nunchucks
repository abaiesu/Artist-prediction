With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone

Baby, stand up
But don't pull them pants up
You're pulling off my shirt
But should I leave my hands up?
Expression of fandom
You know that I've been good
But you still tear the cat up
And when you provoke me
You do it at random
I won't lead you on
But I hope that you can manage
You don't want to man up
You don't want to plan up

But you call me wifey
So what's the big idea?
Do I need to sit right here and fill my ears
While bullshit come out of your lips? I hear
Got me searching for insight insight
Guess I need to call this night off
Riddle me, riddle me that
Mr. Unintentional Ass
And his every interval fast
Throw that cheese and dough in that bag
With that Little Italy swag
Nigga, riddle, riddle me that
Why my mental instantly crash when you enter into me?
Gentle then ya ease up
I'm day dreaming
But now, whoa, I never daydream
But you're jumping from rooftops
And searching and hunting, my ninja
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa

With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
(I've been there, I've been there)
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
(I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why)
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
(I wonder why) I wonder why (I wonder why) I wonder why
(I wonder why) I wonder why (I wonder why)
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
