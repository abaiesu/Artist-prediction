Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
No but in all seriousness, I'm the best rapper alive

You could be the back then and I'll be the now
High as Neverland I'm Peter Pan, we'll keep it down
I got ya wig and ya man and ya nosey
That should be enough to keep a clown on her toseys
Look, Reddit, I gets my credit
I fleek my brows and I lay my edges
Keep my crowd and I pay my dues
Blood red bottoms, you da lady in the shoe
We pop the bottles while you getting all the booze
Every day I brush another nigga like rouge
I'll take the L that the chicken had to ooze
I ooze when they look at my boobs
Look at my ass
Look at my crew
Look at yourself now
Look at your goons
Look at all the views that I got on one tune now
Tell me who the queen and who making all the rules
Rock to my shit
Flock to my shit
This is my flow, putting a lock on my shit
Fuck all of the games, but I'ma bottle my shit
You never could step, hop walk to my shit
Big joint shit like it make big coin
Give a bitch a red dot, sharper than a pin point
Bring bacon back home like a big oink
Gold digger
Chewing out your pocket, that's a bit coin

Seems like you need some juice
All y'all should ween off pills
Somebody needs some chill
(Somebody needs some milk, hahaha)
Make hits, I drop it simple
My boys got white like dental
Your rhymes, you bought like rental
I don't make pop like pimple

She need milk
He need milk
Y'all need milk
Y'all need milk
He need milk
She need milk
He need milk
Need some milk
I don't make pop, I, nah
I don't make pop, I don't
