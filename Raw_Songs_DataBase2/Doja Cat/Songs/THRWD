'Cause I'm tight, 'cause I'm tight
Tighter than American Apparel
I mean
SpooxBeatz
Yo! I'm a monkey
I'm a unicorn and your bitch
She trying to touch my dick

Your rap game weak, said "I'm rap game me"
Now who the fuck gonna stop a girl, I'm kickstand free
And they ask me, "where them ratchets?" I say "that ain't me"
But you know that I've been down for all that ass, blame these
Silly hoes, mad booty when they clap, rain G
And I'm sippin' you know what it gave me mad brain freeze
Hot pink, blunted, burning, British bitch, I'm nothing beats
So they clowning, yeah they clowning
Give a bitch a boost, yeah I'm tippin' on this juice
Mama hop up out the Nissan, sit up in them twenty-twos
See these nookie niggas fake when your kitty ain't the same
See I be up in your city, mind flooded and I'm sank
I'm a shark without a tank, think I'm starving with some bait
And I love it when they hate
And I love it when they hate
And I love it when they hate
Yeah I love it when they hate
Said, "I love it when they hate"
Yeah I love it when they hate
Yeah!

I'm gone, might be on
Where's the Visine
I'm mean, en garde
Baby I'm throwed, I'm throwed
I could tell you throwed
I could tell you throwed
I could tell you gone, might be on
Where's the Visine
I'm mean, en garde
I'm throwed, baby I'm throwed
I could tell you throwed
I could tell you throwed
I could tell you throwed
I could tell you throwed
I could tell you
I-I could tell you throwed
Where's the Visine?
I'm mean en garde
I'm throwed, baby I'm throwed
Baby I'm throwed
I'm throwed
I'm throwed
I'm throwed
I'm throwed
I'm throwed
I'm gone, might be on
Yeah!
