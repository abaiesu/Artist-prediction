I don't know how, but nights get lonely now
They keep appearing in my eyes
Such a warm and tender glow
For just one moment, I remember all
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
On that special, starry night, with your arms around me
Held on tight

Wasn't that the way it was?
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
Wasn't that the love we shared
Or just the restless years when no one cared?

I don't know why it's hard to say goodbye
Or even justify the end
You meant so very much to me
Then to let you go, start my life again
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
'Til that special summer day
When I reached out for you, you just walked away

Wasn't that the way it was?
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
Wasn't that the love we shared
Or just the restless years when no one cared?
