Take me to the subway
Ooh, take me to the subway

It ain't far away, but the night is mine
Like it fine, gonna stay
See you in the morning
Gotta rush, get a bus, make a fuss
Gimme some loving in the morning

Ooh, she makes me feel so good
Instant reaction and ready for love
I got no work, no sweat, no strain
I got to make it to the midnight train

So, take me to the subway, ah
Ooh, take me to the subway

Ooh, city-life is bittersweet
I don't care, take me there on the street
Freedom in the city
Gotta ride, going down underground
Watch me slide, loving in the city

Ooh, she makes me so complete
Heavy in love and light on my feet
I got no work, no sweat, no strain
I got to make it to the midnight train

Take me to the subway, ah-ah
Ooh, take me to the subway
Ah-ah-ah

Ooh, it ain't far away, but the night is mine
Like it fine, gonna stay
See you in the morning
Gotta rush, get a bus, make a fuss
Gimme some loving in the morning

Ooh, she makes me feel so good
Instant reaction and ready for love
I got no work, no sweat, no strain
I got to make it to the midnight train

So, take me to the subway, ah-ah
Ooh, take me to the subway, ah-ah

Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Hey)
Hey
