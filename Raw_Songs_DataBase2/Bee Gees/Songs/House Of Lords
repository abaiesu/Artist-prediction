The butler Henry Baker extinguishes the fires
Whilst sir Frederick Harold Robinson casually retires
Another day tomorrow cries Alan crayon steel
All must be up early to have the morning meal
The maid comes with decanter and to the butler there
Said, 'Sir, here's what you ordered.'
He said, 'No one seems to care.'

It must be good to live in the house of lords
It must be good to live in the house of lords

The house is now in darkness before the coming day
But at five o'clock that morning, the master passed away

The housemaid drew the curtains and the doctors watched the dawn
And the brother Bendix sadly watched the gardener mow the lawn

It must be sad to live in the house of lords
It must be sad to live in the house of lords

Grandma Mildred Marshall was pouring out the tea
When she heard about the news of sir Frederick's tragedy
The hall is now in sadness and everybody cried
On the banks of Burntley river is where sir Frederick lies

It must be sad to live in the house of lords
It must be sad to live in the house of lords
