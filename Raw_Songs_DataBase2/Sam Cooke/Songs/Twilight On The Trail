When it's twilight on the trail,
And I jog along, 
The world is like a dream 
And the ripple of the stream is my song...

When it's twilight on the trail,
And I rest once more, 
My ceiling is the sky 
And the grass on which I lie is my floor...

Never ever have a nickel in my jeans,
Never ever have a debt to pay, 
Still I understand what real contentment means, 
Guess I was born that way...

When it's twilight on the trail,
And my voice is still, 
Please plant this heart of mine 
Underneath the lonesome pine on the hill...
