If his name on it then mine right beside it
Real fucking ride or die

I'm a ride that dick like a stolen car
I got the best pussy that you had thus far
Which bitch you know going hard as me
I'm a ride or die and I don't need the keys
I'm gonna bounce that ass and drop that ass and pop it like a shoot out
I pull them panties down
He smiling like they brought the food out
I hop up on that face and make my hips go like a luau
I showed you I'm a gangsta
Now I wanna see what you about

Ball ball ball ball ball ball
I ain't shy, bust it wide cus I been that bitch
Ball ball ball ball ball ball
I ain't shy, bust it wide cus I been that bitch
Fuck it up

Now don't be playing with a real bitch
Like I won't step back and click clack and hit the kill switch
Like there ain't problems in my life I gotta deal with
Like I won't take them out on you real quick (fuck it up)
Aye, I ain't scared, I'm about that shit
I ain't shy, bust it wide, cus I been that bitch
