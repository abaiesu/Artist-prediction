Girl, look at this shit... This girl really think her nigga faithful
Look at this shit he just sent me, look, bitch, that's our nigga...

Look, oh that's your boyfriend? (Shit)
Well he my head appointment (Okay)
I treat that face just like a horse and throw a saddle on it
Super shiny pussy, look like it got diamonds on it (Yeah)
He spell his name in cursive letters like he signing on it
Waist on nothing but that booty on 100
He got Mickey, they all love it
When he keep throwin' them hundreds
Walk in with my ass out, sugar daddy passed out
Kissed him on the cheek in the mall then he cashed out (Mwah)
I ain't got the time to ask these bitches what they mad 'bout
Prolly 'cause I'm shittin' on them while they got they hands out
Bitch it ain't my fault yo' daddy nutted and you came out
Really, I'm just tryna get some brain like a ring
Go head, forehead, edge up between my legs (Yeah)
'Cause that's all I'm tryna see when I'm laying in the bed
He fell in love with my vernacular
I kiss that dick like Dracula
His last girl was cool but she ain't doin' it like Thee Stallion
Bitch, I know you can't stand it
How I just command it
Wanna take my style but you just can't grab it
You can't keep up with me, bitch, you know you can't compete
Bitch, you know you better not ever bring yo' nigga round to jeet
Bitch, I'm getting tutor, getting head up in a Uber
Ride his face just like a scooter, whatever I say he do it
Bitch, I'm getting tutor, getting head up in a Uber
Ride his face just like a scooter, whatever I say he do it, yeah

Yung Tina Snow bitch, keep ya nigga on a leash, ahh
