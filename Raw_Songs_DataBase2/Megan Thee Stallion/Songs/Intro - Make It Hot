Come up in this bitch, make it rock (rock)
Put it in your face make it pop
These niggas know Megan need top

These bitches ain't really bout action (uh unh)
A lot of these hoes just acting (ew)
I'll wrap a bitch up, that's traction
Then put her trash ass back in the trash can
And I'm a bad motherfucker with the backhand
And if you come too close imma crack in
See I already peep where you lacking
You ain't even hear me when I came in the back end
Oh there I go, Stallion hoe

No red meat on my lobster plate
Ion go back and forth, ion play them games
I let the bitch play herself, that's masturbate
I'm new in the game, that's rookie
Ain't nobody had these cookies
If you wanna meet a pimp then book me
Ian met a bitch yet that shook me
Imma real big dog, you a copy cat
You a talent show hoe, imma platinum plaque
Bitch I'm real in the field, you a practice mat
And I'm coming for ya neck, better watch your back

Another head doctor tryna come lick me

My purse made out of piranhas
Meaning my money private
Meaning my name is heavy
Meaning lil bitch don't test me
Meaning no bitch gon check me
Meaning bitch come correctly
