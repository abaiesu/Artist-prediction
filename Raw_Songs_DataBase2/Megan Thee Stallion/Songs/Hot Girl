If he ain't talking 'bout no money tell him "bye, bye, bye" (Boy bye!)
And if you see a mad hoe tell her "hah hah hah"

Hey!

I told her "If you go against me, you a damn fool!" (Bitch you dumb)
But keep talking 'bout me, bitch, that's all you can do (Oh, okay!)
But keep my cat up out ya mouth, cause that's ya man's food
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (She like 'what?')

Watch ya' mouth before I leave here with your boo

All the hot girls make it pop, pop, pop

And tease you with the nigga
Nah nee, nah nee, boo-boo

He open up and he catch it
He suck these titties, these legends
I throw that booty, he fetch it
This pussy really a present

He gone eat through the paper
He tryna eat through these panties
He bob his head like it's jammin'
