Neva let a broke nigga sex me
Neva let no hoe test me
Neva been scared of the money
Neva let em take nothing from me
Neva ever, neva ever ever
A nigga get read like a letter
She think she bad but I'm better
These bitches tryna play catch-up

Shut the fuck up when I'm talkin' lil bitch
Put yo head down when you talk to a pimp
Excuse me I got some big racks in my purse and right now they just making me walk with a limp
Bottles be showing me love

Then she come bring me my cut
Shut the fuck up when I'm talkin' lil nigga (be quiet)
Fuck is you going through
I can tell these bitches spoil you, but I'm a playa so I see the toy in you
You tryna act like you tough, ha, boy I'm callin' ya bluff
He tellin me what he not gone do
Wait a minute, first of all, who is you talkin to

You ain't saving hoes I ain't saving niggas either
Don't try to tell me you real
Blowing my phone and you don't pay the bill
Don't got no money and stay tryna chill
Hell naw
Fuck that shit
Do what I say or go get a new bitch
You know I mean what I say when I say it
I hate a nigga that's always complaining
Hop and then top off a bitch like a genie
I'll turn her color to purple like Celie
I'm turning into a monster unleash me
Bitch you know better be cool when you see me
They want me out of me character
Lately I been in my act
I'll take your boo and I won't give him back
I'll wrap my legs round his head like a track
