You've got a man, but you fuckin' around
Riskin' it all baby just to be down
Don't know if you know just what you started
But I can see you like to play with fire darling, hey
Your man just hit the bar to grab a chalice for you two
He turn his back just for a sec and look at what you do
Sending me the supersonic signal, hey
You ain't lay a finger but I feel you
Independent woman I won't tell you how to act
But you and I both know we could be gone before he's back

You've got a man, but you fuckin' around
Its funny but its real yah know
Riskin' all baby just to be down
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

Don't ask questions if we just sexting
I got situations no conformations
Everybody wants to know who Megan dating
That depends on whatever the day is
I got me a European papi out of Italy
And he like to model but he always likes to picture me
Flying over seas in these just hips be
Send him a pic from the back
Just to give him a tease
I got a man in Texas, that where the best is
Down south hottie and he's cool never stress me
West coast thang, I'm in love with his slang
And he keep it hood when we bang aye

I got a man but I'm fucking around
Cause I'm young and can't be tied down
You got a girl she got nothing on me
Because we young and we do the same thing

You've got a man, but you fuckin' around
Riskin' it all baby just to get down
You, you, you, you, I know you're so wrong for it
What we've been doing this place seems to ruin
This love thang I'm only half as wrong you
You know that I know you're so wrong for it

What we've been doing this place seems to ruin
This love thang but I'm only half as wrong you
You've got a man, but you fuckin' around
Riskin' it all baby just to be down
You've got a man, but you fuckin' around
Riskin' it all baby just to be down
You've got a man, but you fuckin' around
Riskin' it all baby just to be down

I got a man but I'm fucking around
Cause I'm young and can't be tied down
