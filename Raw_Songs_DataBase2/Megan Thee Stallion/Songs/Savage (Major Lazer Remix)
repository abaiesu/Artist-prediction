Had to exit cheesy niggas out my circle like a pizza

Ion shop on Insta boutiques
All them lil ass clothes only fit fake booties

Pussy like water, I'm unbothered and relaxing
I would never trip on a nigga, if I had him

Beefing with you bitches, really getting kinda boring
If it ain't about the money, then you know I'm gon ignore it
