(Real hot girl shit, ah!)

Ay, let's be clear
I quit fuckin' on my old niggas last year
This pussy ain't even in your bracket
Rich bitch problems I'm a LV addict
Walk in and I take your nigga automatic
Fuck him in a mansion but I give it to him ratchet
All this drip make a broke hoe panic
I'm tryna get your nigga out his hat like a rabbit
Aye, hot girl shit
Shut the fuck up lil' bitch, you be lyin'
Say that you breakin' these niggas, you cryin'
He wanna go on a date and you buyin'
He got to be out his mu'fucking mind
If he thinkin' I'm finna cum off the ass
And he thinkin' he ain't gon' come off no cash
No I'm not sayin' that I prostitute
But you wanna see me so pay for the view
I'm lettin' him know that I know my worth
If he ain't big enough, finna get curved
How you so comfortable talkin' that shit
Walkin' around with lil bitty dick
You got to be out your mu'fucking mind
Thinkin' you hotter than me, hoe you tried it
Get on that mic and you know I get live
You want that smoke and you know where to find it

Look, you got to be out your mu'fucking mind
Thinkin' you hotter than me, hoe you tried it (you tried it)
Ah, aye, ah, aye
Look, how you so comfortable talkin' that shit? (How? How?)

Look, boy I'm too player, you know you can't play me
I turn a stiff nigga into a baby
Fuck like a freak but I act like a lady
Still in love with me if we ever dated
These bitches biting my swag and I peep it
Hop off my pussy or go 'head and eat it
Cocky as fuck bitch you know I'm conceited
I'm the hot girl and I got these hoes heated
Megan Thee Stallion they know I'm a animal
My flow is sick and they can't find an antidote
I met your man, now he can not remember you
Come to the court make him suck like a tentacle
Open her mouth then I pour in a shot
Everywhere I go, I'm making it pop
 cause bitch I be hot
Name a bitch badder than me, you can not

Ah, ah, aye, yeah, look!
Name a bitch badder than me, you can not
Name a bitch badder than me, you can not
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
You want that smoke and you know where to find it
Thinkin' you hotter than me, hoe you tried it
Ah, ah, ah!
