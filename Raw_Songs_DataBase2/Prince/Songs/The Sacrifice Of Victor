I was born on a blood stained table
Cord wrapped around my neck
Epileptic 'til the age of 7
I was sure heaven marked the deck

We sacrifice
I know joy lives 'round the corner
(Joy for sale down on the corner)
We sacrifice
One day I'll visit her I'm gonna
(Out on my block I'm just a loner)
We sacrifice
When she tell me everything (tell me)
That's when the angels sing (sacrifice)
That's when the victory is sho 'nuff (sho 'nuff down with the sacrifice)
We sacrifice

Help me
Go on say it, preacher

Mama held up her baby 4 protection
From a man with a strap in his hand
Ask the Victor 'bout pain and rejection
U think he don't when he do understand

(Joy for sale down on the corner)
We sacrifice
One day I'll visit her I'm gonna
(Out on my block I'm just a loner)

1967 in a bus marked public schools
Rode me and a group of unsuspecting political tools
Our parents wondered what it was like 2 have another color near
So they put their babies together 2 eliminate the fear
We sacrifice
Yes we did, fighting one another
We sacrifice
Go on say it preacher
All because of color
The angel of hate - she taught me how 2 kick her
If she called me anything but Victor (u mean like nigger?)
If the only thing that tells me is father time
Then sacrifice is the mutha sublime - we love it

Listen mutha - we sacrifice

Go on... go on... go on say it preacher

We sacrifice

Well, well, well, well

What is sacrifice?
Hold yo' text, deacon

Never understood my old friends laughing
They got high when everything else got wrong (pass the booze up here)
Dr. King was killed and the streets they started burnin'
When the smoke was cleared, their high was gone
Education got important, so important 2 Victor
A little more important than ripple and weed
Bernadette's a lady, and she told me (what she say?)
"Whatever u do son, a little discipline is what u need,
Is what u need, u need to sacrifice"

But we got something
Heavy on our minds (we sacrifice)

Sometimes, u gotta leave the one u love
Somebody, anybody, everybody wave your hand
Around the corner, there's another sacrifice (joy around the corner)

Say u got 2 go through it (go through it)
U got 2 go through it all (go through it all)
High glory, yeah
Sell it, don't tell it, don't tell me (joy around the corner)

Lord I might get tired,
But I, I've got 2 keep on (we sacrifice)
Walkin' down this road, (we sacrifice)
Keep on walkin' down this road (joy around the corner)
When I reach my destination (we sacrifice)
My name will be Victor

Amen
