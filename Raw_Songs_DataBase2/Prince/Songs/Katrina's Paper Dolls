Katrina makes paper dolls
One doll for every day
One doll for every day her old man's been gone
Katrina makes paper dolls
For every time he told her
For every time he told her that their love was too strong

There's no way to tell who's real and who's not
Baby, it's so much harder when your body's hot
She says that love is just a game or so it seems in many circles
Maybe that's what makes her world go round

Katrina makes paper dolls
They all look the same
They play the same games
Katrina makes paper dolls
It's better than being lonely
And love will make you lonely in the eyes of this dame, ooh, oh

There's no way to tell who's real and who's not
Baby, it's so much harder when your body's hot
She says love is just a game or so it seems in many circles
Maybe that's what makes her world go round

Katrina makes paper dolls
It's better than being lonely
Love will make you lonely
In the eyes of this dame
They're all just paper dolls

(La, la, la, la)
Da, da
(La, la, la, la)
Da, da
(La, la, la, la)
Ooh
Katrina's paper dolls
Love will make you horny
(La, la, la, la)
Ooh
La, la, la, la
Katrina's paper dolls
Ooh
Katrina's paper dolls
Katrina's paper dolls
Katrina's paper dolls
