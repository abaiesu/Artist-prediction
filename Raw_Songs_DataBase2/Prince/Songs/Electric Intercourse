I feel some kind of love for you
And I don't even know your name
This is the kind of love that takes two
I want you and I'm not ashamed

'Cause baby, you shock my wild
With a sexual electricity extraordinaire
Come and take advantage, undress me
I don't even know you, I don't even care

I feel some kind of sexual current
Tell me do you feel it too?
Our bodies want to be together
Girl, I wanna be with you

Electric is my body, baby
I will shock you with my lips
Darling, don't you know
Your Technicolor climax is at my fingertips

Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
Don't you wanna?
Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
Don't you wanna make love, love, love?

Electric is my body, baby
I will shock you with my lips
Darling, don't you know
Your Technicolor climax is at my fingertips

Electric intercourse
Don't you wanna?
Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
Don't you wanna make love?
Don't you wanna make?

Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
Don't you wanna?
Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
Don't you want to make love?
Yeah, yeah...
