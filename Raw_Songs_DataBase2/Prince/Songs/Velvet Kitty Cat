You wanna rock, you wanna roll my velvet kitty cat
She's man's best friend, furry and cuddly and fat
Take a swing, you're up to bat
Velvet kitty cat

And every day and all night my velvet kitty cat
Wish she had a boyfriend but they were all rats
Mmm, there was nothin' underneath their hats
Sad kitty cat
Mmm

And I don't want no money, no fancy cars, that ain't where it's at
I just want a body eat up all my cookies till he gets fat
Mmm
I want a true love and that's that
Velvet kitty cat

Go ahead on and play it cat

You wanna rock, you wanna roll my velvet kitty cat
She's man's best friend, furry and cuddly and fat
I'd let you pet her but then you gotta skat
Velvet kitty cat
Mmm

Mmm
I'd let you pet her but then you gotta skat
Velvet kitty cat

I want a true love and that's that
Velvet kitty cat
Mmm

You can pet her but then you gotta skat
Velvet kitty cat
Mmm

Velvet kitty cat
Mmm
