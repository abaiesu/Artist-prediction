You went to school to learn, boy
Things you never, never knew before
Mmmhmm, like "I before E, except after C"
And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you all about love, boy
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, boy
Your education ain't complete
Te-te-te-teacher's gonna show you how to get an "A" (how to get an "A")
Spell "me" and "you" and add the two
Listen to me, baby, that's all you gotta do

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon boy

Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it shake it, baby
1, 2, 3, baby
A, B, C, baby
Do-re-mi, baby
That's how easy love can be

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

Lemme teach how to sing it out
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, lemme show you what it's all about

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

A, B, C
1, 2, 3
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
Baby, you and me
