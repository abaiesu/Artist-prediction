Lift up your head
Wash off your mascara
Here take my Kleenex
Wipe that lipstick away
Show me your face clean as the morning
I know things were bad
But now they're okay

Suddenly Seymour is here to provide you
With sweet understanding
Seymour's your friend

Nobody ever treated me kindly
Daddy left early
Mama was poor
I'd meet a man
And I'd follow him blindly
He'd snap his fingers
Me, I'd say, "Sure"

Suddenly Seymour (Suddenly Seymour)
He purified me (He purified you)
Suddenly Seymour (Suddenly Seymour)
Showed me I can (Yes, you can)

Learn how to be more
The girl that's inside me
With sweet understanding
With sweet understanding
With sweet understanding
With sweet understanding
With sweet understanding

Seymour's your man!
