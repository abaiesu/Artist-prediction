Album: InsideProblems

// Underlands //

Oh I can't get over this moon
And all creatures under the sun
Moving through their days in a state of oblivion

Stars don't owe you anything
Don't give a damn about your nations
Feel the slightest obligation

I mean, listen
What if the world goes spinning off its axis?
And what if the moon begins to wane before it waxes?

Wrapped in darkness, you take my hand
Through all the chambers of the underland
Like this penny on the railroad track
If you go too far, you know you can't go back

Oh, I've never been here before
Deep inside earth's molten core
No need for clothes or for eyes to see

So find yourself a pair of ears
Gonna be down here for many years
Just listen out for that subterranean river of tears

Well, not exactly hell
More like a nocturnal paradise
Not exactly heaven either
I'd say 'bout half as nice

We're at the end now, you've run aground
And all the sound waves have gone underground
There's a threshold between the here and hereafter
To cross a river, you know you gotta take a raft there

Stars don't owe you anything
Don't give a damn about your nation
Or feel the slightest obligation

Oh, I can't get over this moon now
Oh, I can't get over this moon
Ooh, ooh

// Lone Didion //

She's alone, she's alone, lone, lone Didion
She's alone, she's alone, lone, lone Didion
Get along, get along without her
Get along, get along without him
Lone Didion

Every Saturday night, she came in with him
Table six in the back, tall beer and a gin
Now she comes in alone, lone Didion
If he lies, says he'll keep you safer than him
And he leaves and he makes you pay for your gin
Now she comes in alone, lone Didion

Put the top down, skip town, yellow Corvette
Up to the East Bay, trees sway, never get wet
Gonna head for the hills of Montana
Gotta get away from these mad Santa Anas
Lone Didion

Every Saturday night, she came in with him
Table six in the back, tall beer and a gin
Now she comes in alone, lone Didion
And he lies, says he'll keep you safer
And he leaves and he makes you pay for
Now she comes in alone, lone Didion

// Fixed Positions //

When your position remains fixed, my dear
Results can be mixed, I fear
There's a stasis
No new ideas and no new faces
Misadventures and far-flung places
Don't get me wrong, it's not dull

But if you stay here long enough, I fear we'll always be this way
And if you're screwing up your face, oh, won't it always stay that way?
Always be this way
Will we always stay this way?

You know there really isn't much preventing
The way you see the world cementing
There's a stony creep in
Cradle to grave or forever weeping
Rounded on our sides, you're forever sleeping
Promise to resist until you die (Resist until you die)
Promise to resist until you die

An object set in motion (An object set in motion)
The arbiter of time (Arbiter of time)
The unexpressed emotion (Unexpressed emotion)
Capital crime (Capital crime)
So pick a random number (Pick a random number)
Making sure it's prime (Making sure it's prime)
Pick a random number between one and one-hundred-and-nine

Stay here long enough and you will always be this way
And when you're screwing up your face, oh, won't it always stay that way?
And when we're sheltering in place, oh, won't we always be this way?
Always be this way
Will we always stay this way? (Will we always stay this way? Will we always stay this way?)
Will we always stay this way? (Will we always stay this way? Will we always stay this way?)
Will we always be this way? (Will we always stay this way?)

When your position remains fixed
Results can be mixed
I fear there's a stasis

// Inside Problems //

Molting, porous, sheathing
Breathing through the skin
Sloughing, breaching, preening
Exoskeleton

Don't talk to me now, I'm molting
Don't tell me that it's revolting
Every inch of us
Every inch of us
Every inch of us a walking miracle

I just got born
I just got born
Oh my God, I just got born

And all your juvenile plumage
Is falling to the forest floor
You lost your teenage plumage
So you make the same mistakes again once more

Don't tell me that you can't see her
Try as you might, you can't deter
Every inch of her
Every inch of her
Every inch of her a walking miracle

She just got born
She just got born
Oh my God, she just got born

First, you think you'll fall apart
Loose the ties that bind
Incubate your bleeding heart now
Little piece of you you leave behind you

When all your inside problems
Really aren't your problem anymore
And all your inside problems
Are passing through the threshold of your door
And all your juvenile plumage
Is falling to the forest floor
You lost your teenage plumage
So you can make the same mistakes again once more

Don't talk to me now, I'm molting
Don't tell me that it's revolting
Ah, oh my God, I just got born

I just got born
I just got born
Oh my God
Oh my God, I just got—

// The Night Before Your Birthday //

On the night before your birthday
I set down to write this song
But I was, I wasn't sure what to say
Afraid these words'll come out wrong
That you will always be my darlin'
'Til the end, end of measured time
Like that pair of nestin' starlings
We're growin' more and more entwined

How the hell did you know
When all you know is what you don't know?

Stumble in the wilderness
Burrs hopelessly stuck
Instinct finally worked for once
Or was it just, or was it just dumb luck?

And it's not like strikin' lightnin' (Not like strikin' lightnin')
That keeps breakin' Heaven's vows (Breakin' Heaven's vows)
Or that slow and vicious tightenin' (Slow and vicious tightenin')
That what the heart allows (What the heart allows)
I could count the ways I love you
But I was never one for maths
While the heavens up above you
Keep gettin' filled with sociopaths

Oh, siestas in June
Catlike repose

Lightnin' in the afternoon
Lizards on the tile
Music from another room
Let's just linger, let's just linger for a while

On the night before your birthday
I set down to write this song
But I wasn't sure what to say
Afraid these words'll come out wrong

// Make A Picture //

Oh, I don't wanna ride on your shoulders
And put you in the hospital
I just wanna roll away boulders
That they said was impossible
'Cause don't you know that I'm
An irrepressible optimist working with a fatal flaw
Running in the streets like feral cats
Will be hard to mistake any and raise a paw

Tell us what you think you saw
What you think you saw
Tell us what you think you saw

Make a picture
Make it snappy
Make a picture
Don't look so happy

All those scowling faces
All those furrowed brows
All those burned-out cases
Make 'em take a bow (make 'em take a bow)
About some smiling faces
Come on and show us how
Never mind the braces
Love you anyhow
We love you anyhow

I don't wanna hear what's impossible
Falling with the Shepard's tone
And if we're ever gonna get out of this hospital
You will never sleep alone
Listen to the cries of the wounded metropolis
Denizens on tender hooks
Listen to the cries of the pliable populace
Giving us the dirty looks

They're giving us the dirty looks
Dirty looks now
They're giving us the dirty looks

Make a picture
Make it snappy
Make a picture
Don't look so happy

All those scowling faces
All those furrowed brows
All those burned-out cases
Make 'em take a bow (make 'em take a bow)
About some smiling faces
Come on and show us how
Never mind the braces
Love you anyhow
We love you anyhow

Love you anyhow
Love you anyhow
You will never sleep alone
Love you anyhow
You will never sleep alone

// Atomized //

They're gonna try to get a rise to unseat you
They'll demagnetize your poles
And you know they're gonna try to delete you
So now you're atomized, unwhole

You know better start making your apologies
Stop blaming technology, yeah
Blaming technology, whoa
May you please, may you start making your apologies, oh
Blaming technology, yeah
Blaming technology, oh

(We're only human, that's what they tell us)
Here's what I say to them: "What is your point?"
(Is each of us an island, or more like Finland?)
Here's what I say to them: "Things fall apart"

Now there's something in her eyes that completes you
Every time she cries, it brings you low
And just the merest sigh can defeat you
How can you be so wise and still not know?

You know better start making your apologies
Stop blaming technology, yeah
Blaming technology, whoa
May you please, may you start making your apologies, oh
Blaming technology, yeah
Blaming technology, oh

(We're only human, that's what they tell us)
Here's what I say to them: "What is your point?"
(Is each of us an island, or more like Finland?)
Here's what I say to them: "Things fall apart"

Making your apologies, oh
Blaming technology, yeah
Blaming technology, oh
Start making your apologies, oh
Blaming technology, yeah
Blaming technology, whoa

// Faithless Ghost //

I seen your face before
When I was waxin' the kitchen floor
Your features carved in the faux marble linoleum
Cicadas dronin' in the midsummer's lonely hum, ba-ba-ba-ba

On this day, twenty years before
I heard the slammin' of the back screen door
I thought I was accustomed to big surprises
Until I met your faithless ghost

She takes a silver comb from her hair
Falls over her shoulders bare
Floatin' from room to room
And I was to be her groom
Oh, it ain't fair

Oh, my sweet entity
Why don't you come to visit me?
Instead, you taunt me
Listen, I want you to haunt me (Ba-ba-ba-ba)

In this, our shared history
Who gets to use the apostrophe?
Back door, kitchen floor, vapor rises
Yeah, she's a faithless ghost
Lord, she's my faithless ghost

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

She takes a silver comb from her hair
Falls over her shoulders bare
She's floatin' from room to room
And I was to be her groom
Oh, it ain't fair

Your worldly possessions don't mean a thing to me
Only thing left within is sanctity

Back door, kitchen floor, vapor rises
I thought I was accustomed to big surprises
Back door, kitchen floor, vapor rises
Yeah, she's a faithless ghost
Mm, she's my faithless ghost
Yeah, she is my faithless

I seen your face before

// Eight //

One just reached for her gun
Two's slumped in the corner
Three is making a plea for someone to adore her
Five is buried alive
Six is out on the street throwing bricks now
Seven, let's just skip over seven, shall we and get to eight

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, no
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Since my days are numbered, I am unencumbered by fate
Don't you look so certain until you lay your burden down

Nine is waiting to shine, ten is stuck at the border
Eleven's my two-legged brethren, twelve is a hoarder
Now, thirteen just might be the worst
Fourteen has a secret and it's ready to burst
Now fifteen goes with the ice queen into the foyer

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh, oh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

I sense my days are numbered, I am unencumbered by fate, fate
Don't you look so certain until you lay your burden down
Since my days are numbered, I feel unencumbered by fate
Don't you look so certain 'til you lay your burden down

// Stop N' Shop //

Thought the wall was a gun
And that the gun was a flag
That the flag was a truck
And that the truck a mighty bird of prey

'Fraid they'd take it away from you
Why would they take it away from you?

For without it, where would you be?
At the stop 'n' shop at Route 43, that's where you'd be now

Objects may appear to be more than they appear to be
More than this reality, a salve for your insecurity
More than what they are
It's what you think you are
Woah, you hear that dissonance now (Dissonance)
Yeah, the sound of sweet romance now (Sweet romance)
Mmm, it's an awkward dance (Awkward dance)
Mmm, the sound of sweet romance now

Oh, listen, isn't there something that's missing here?
Isn't there more to choose from than false choices and fear?

For without it, where would you be?
At the stop 'n' shop at Route 43, that's where you'd be

Thought the hat was a fist
And that the fist was a bust
Of a horse or an obelisk
Clenched fist to the arsonist grist for the mill of a pacifist?
Sounds like a job for Sisyphus

'Fraid they'd take it away from you
Why would they take it away from you?

For without it, where would you be?
At the stop 'n' shop at Avenue B, that's where you'd be

Objects may appear to be more than they appear to be
More than this reality a binding agent for the majority
More than what they are
It's what you think you are
Woah, you hear that dissonance now (Dissonance)
Yeah, the sound of sweet romance now (Sweet romance)
Mmm, it's an awkward dance (Awkward dance)
Mmm, the sound of sweet, sweet romance
The sound of sweet—
Mild sounds of sweet, sweet romancing

Oh, the sound of sweet romance

// Never Fall Apart //

Oh, dear friend, won't you speak to me?
I'm down here, down on bended knee
Speak on telephone
Soft, dulcet tone
And I will listen

Am I or am I not your love?
When push comes to shove

"La-la-la," go the singing bones
From the shaky thrones

And never fall apart again
And never fall, fall apart

Never fall apart again
And never fall, fall apart

Oh, on the boulevard
Twisting broken burning shards
Walk softly with empty hand
Strike up the band

And never fall apart again
And never fall, fall apart
And never fall apart (Again)
And never fall, fall apart
And never fall apart again
And never fall, fall apart
