No one can
Be my man be my man
Be my man be my man
Be my man be my man
No one can
Be my woman be my woman
Be my woman

One ear to the ground
One dog at my neck
One tongue to my tongue
Wanting to protect me
From

No one can
Be my man be my man
Be my man be my man
Be my man be my man
No one can
Be my woman be my woman
Be my woman

One ear to the floor
My dog barking loud
Couldn't tell for sure
Where the screaming sound
Was coming from

One ear to your womb
Puppy on the floor
Baby's coming soon
Wonder if she'll know
Where she's come from
