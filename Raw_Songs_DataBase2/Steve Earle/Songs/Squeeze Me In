You know that it's been such a long time, honey
Since I've been ridin' next to you
I ain't a-waitin' in no long line, honey
You know I'm only passin' through

Well, I got here without warning
Well, I'm leavin' in the mornin'
You won't find me hangin' 'round your door tomorrow like your other men
Hey darlin', squeeze me in

I've been sleepin' by the road side, honey
Holdin' my suitcase next to me
You can't ignore me 'cause it's been tried, honey
I'm gonna get you, wait and see

Well, I got here without warning
Well, I'm leavin' in the mornin'
You won't find me hangin' 'round your door tomorrow like your other men
Hey darlin', squeeze me in
Darlin', squeeze me in
