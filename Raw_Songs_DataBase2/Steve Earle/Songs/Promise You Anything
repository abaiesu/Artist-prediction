No curtains on my window
Outside the sun is sinking low
I feel you letting go
I will promise you anything
Wind whispering in your ear
I'll tell you what you want to hear
If you'll only let me near
I will promise you anything

Well, I don't have to prove my intentions are golden
I don't have to tell you where we're goin'
Feel somethin' wild baby out there blowin'
If you follow me

Run with me if you dare
Hold on I'm gonna take you there
Solemn as a prayer
I will promise you anything

No curtains on my window
Outside the moon is hangin' low
True colors start to show
I will promise you anything
