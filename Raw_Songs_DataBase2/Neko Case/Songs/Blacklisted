Fast train

Where do your passengers wait

What's at the heart of your engine's rage


To what smooth place at the end of the line

With crackling fires and quiet plains

Do the trees bend down

Fold their limbs round you

Welcome home faithful one

We forgive you


Slow down fast train

Slow down fast train

Take me with you
