So far away

Curses wild upon you

Hungry and gaining

Porchlight burns so far away

Miles away


Days have gone by and I've barely gone

Safe on the road that speeds from your front door

I can't turn around 'cause I long to be forgiven


It hangs in my hair and the hems of my clothes

I thought in the madness my arms could not hold

I can't tell you why 'cause I long to be forgiven


So far away

Curses wild upon you

Hungry and gaining

Porchlight burns so far away

Miles away


I'm sorry to tread on your patience, my dear

My heart might be willing by this time next year

I can't make you wait 'cause I long to be forgiven


So far away

Curses wild upon you

Hungry and gaining

Porchlight burns so far away

Miles away
