Somebody put me on a leash
I'm buckin' wild like the AK 'cause it came from Kaytra
I point it down so you can't escape her
Even if you duck, duck goose neck, your Canada Goose wet
Balled up from your boots to your crewneck
This that blue flame
Put the green to this shit, this that blue dream
Put your schemes to test in real life, bet you need a vest
Bet you need a vet
Niggas bitin' crazy, already seen death by rabies
Niggas gettin' lazy, diggin' holes and pushin' daisies
Boonk actin' crazy like it's gravy lookin' crazy on the internet
Niggas dirty dancin', no Patrick Swayze
Lover don't get caught on your Savion Glover for these white boys
They out here cancellin' plans at the last minute
You'll denied it then admit it, that type mad different
But I ain't mad, I'm high as a kite
Trip is supplying the light, niggas can't buy this advice
Listen, caution would question this shit, niggas that claim you bitchin'
Get straight to the money whenever your hands start itchin'
Know that if you ride me, you'll never be Mike or Pippen
And you got to know that ain't me dissin'
Dodgin' smokescreens, that ain't the piff in the air or, niggas is smokin' different
Could read the same Bible but, niggas quote it different
They finna do clean water just like prohibition
I already know the mission, why they keep on missin', we grow more efficient

Gotta have it
Please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin'
Make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics
We get through them locks when they padded
I never had it
Got to get to free, got to have it

Gotta have it
Please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin'
Make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics
We get through them locks when they padded
I never had it
Got to get to free, got to have it


Ay yo, these nigga mad thirsty for the fame and glory
Yous as basic as a baby daddy on Maury
Fuck the fake chain blingin', autotune singin'
I'm a killer bee straight out the hive and I'm stingin'
Dirty slang doctor botox your girl's lips up
We soul training 'em like Don Corneil, get your dick sucked
We fist fuckin' the money, we runnin' down jewelers
We flooded backstage out like ice in the coolers
Fuck the rulers, Donald Trump is a piece of shit
I got 36 chambers, hollow tip in the clip
Smoke a dick, no time for the games and dramatics
We blessed every morning with today's mathematics
Put a hole in your cabbage, quick to fuck up your party
Off your whole set nigga, you can ask Cardi
We used to lose our cracks when we was runnin' from the Narci
Now we watchin' shark tank, robes up in the Marqis


Gotta have it
Please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin'
Make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics
We get through them locks when they padded
I never had it
Got to get to free, got to have it

Gotta have it
Please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin'
Make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics
We get through them locks when they padded
I never had it
Got to get to free, got to have it
