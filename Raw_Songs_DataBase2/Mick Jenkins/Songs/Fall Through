Don't you feel the soul?
That's just you as well
Of all the things you know, do you know yourself?
Well enough to trust the way you go
When you don't, know the way
See the light, still hesitate
See the light, hesitate

Had to fall on his knees for a second
Stop, dropped and rolled in the middle of this fire
And the smoke (smoke) had to go and breathe for a second
Plus I needed direction, a fork in every road at like three intersections
Pray for the sermon, I'm seeking his blessing
This ain't no sermon but vermin ain't never want to see they reflection
Come and see his reflection
Like... mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the most hated of them all?
Most creative of them all
Who's post-racial, who's the most basic?
Who despite that love them all?
So sticks and stones I rub them off
At this hater conjunction I'm an apostrophe, above them all
That's why I keep my circle small
Seen so many rush as Limbaugh
Niggas talking shit that I just cannot trust at all
But trust I fall, you can trust I'll tell you just how I trip
Before I ever power trip, brought the light like a power strip
Fuck a Powerade, we bringing water
On some sraight 'Black Power' shit
Shift the culture watch the power shift
Fist raised, nigga proud as shit
Even if you wasn't privy to the trees know you hear the leaves loud as shit
When autumn asked you
Do you (do you do you do you do you)...

When autumn falls, you see the leaves (light, light)
You feel the breeze, you feel the breeze (I see the light)

When autumn falls, you see the leaves
You feel the breeze, you feel the breeze
Descendants of the realest souls
Children of the Indigo
You feel me, y'all don't hear me though (When autumn falls, you see the leaves)
You feel me, y'all don't hear me though (You feel the breeze, you feel the breeze)

Don't you feel the soul?
That's just you as well
Of all the things you know, do you know yourself?
Well enough to trust the way you go
When you don't, know the way
See the light, still hesitate
See the light, hesitate

We descendants of the illest souls
Children of the Indigo
I been all around the globe, different languages they feel me they don't hear me though
Told us we was inferior, we imperial
I've been talking all this Lake Superior
If you curios, I been spreading love in a more serial sense
Politicking with my big homie Sensai
City really been on fire since 10Day
Shave the truffles on my penne I'm eating good
Nigga crooked but my pen straight I've been straight
Concentrating on these compositions
Fuck the opposition gotta do with my position?
Is it popping or is y'all just politicking

'Cause I might fall through if I catch the breeze
Know you probably missed the roots, but I know you seen the leaves (seen the leaves)
We descendants of the illest souls
Children of the Indigo
'Cause I might fall through if I catch the breeze
Know you probably missed the roots, but I know you seen the leaves (seen the leaves)
We descendants of the illest souls
Children of the Indigo
Fall, fall through
Fall through if I, breeze breeze
Fall through, if-
Know you probably missed the roots
Fall through, breeze, breeze
Breeze, breeze, know you probably missed the-
Fall through, fall through
Fall through, fall through, fall through
Fall-, fall through
