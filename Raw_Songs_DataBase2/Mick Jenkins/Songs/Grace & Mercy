Wake up thanking God (ay)
Wake up thanking God
Wake up, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercies

It's a Game of Thrones, all I see is Cersei
I stay with the squad, still be smoking percies though
Have your weapon formed, but that shit can't hurt me
I stay in the sun, need my skin like Hershey's (yeah)
Do everything well, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
I'm 'bout to run it up, monetizing controversy
Bitch you want cut with us
Playing all the roles where the fuck is Eddie Murphy?
Niggas thirsty, you want poppin' shit in person
Niggas Hercules on the internet
Ain't no bitch in me, come and search me
Slutted out, high fashion fam, I'm fly with my silhouette
Thousand thread count, soft-ass niggas prone to pillow talk
Neighbors think it's dope, dodging comet with these kilowatts
Six-figure quote off a motherfucking keynote presentation
That's a Ted talk, say less let the bread talk

Every day I wake up thanking God
Yeah, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercies (ay)
Wake up thanking God
Ay, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercies
Every day I wake up thanking God
Yeah, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercies (ay)
Wake up thanking God
Ay, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercies

I got on my knees, said a prayer, caught a blessing on these niggas
Count my blessings on these niggas, count my blessings
