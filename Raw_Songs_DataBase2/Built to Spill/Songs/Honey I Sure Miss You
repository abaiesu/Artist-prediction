Honey, I sure miss you
And I long to kiss you
And I miss you so much
Your loving touch

You brought out the best in me
Can you bring it back to me?
'Cause I love you so much
Your loving touch

Every time I think about you
Love comes down
But you're still not around

Honey, I sure miss you
And I wish you were here today
'Cause I want you so much
Your loving touch

Nothing more important to me
No one any more closer to me
'Cause I love you so much
Your loving touch

Every time I think about you
Love comes down
But you're still not around

Honey, I sure miss you
And I long to kiss you
And I miss you so much
Your loving touch

Every time I think about you
Love comes down
But you're still not around
