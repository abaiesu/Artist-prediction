One, two, three

I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain't nobody wants to know

I've been
Sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

So 'round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I've ever seen
Hey, sonny, won't you sign
Right along the dotted line?
What you sayin'? Are you playin'?
Sure you don't mean me?

Sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

(Now I'll tell you what happened)

They took me to a room without a table
They said, "Blow your trumpet into here."
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin'
All the people wanna listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

And I was
Sleepin' like a princess
Never touched the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't wanna go home
(Have to have some fun. . .)

Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable
And that I owe the man a million bucks a year
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here
Yeah

I'm back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game

I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry and I
Sure do wanna go home
(Yeah)
