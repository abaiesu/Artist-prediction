Now that all these walls are down, wonder what I'll tell you

You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die

Count the number of beings you are, see how long it takes you

You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die

You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die
