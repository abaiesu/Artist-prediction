When the sun is rising over streets so barren
Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92, I listen
To what my father said

Keep all your dreams, keep  standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can
When you can

How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed
But my mama said

Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall (oh I, nah, nah, nah)
If you are strong you cannot fall (if you are strong)
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can
When you can

If you cannot, oh!
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side
Woo, oh!
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do

Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
There is more out there
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall

Give me morning
When you're gone to yourself
Woo!
Yeah!
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall)
If you are strong you cannot fall)
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall)
(If you are strong you cannot fall)
Thanks for doing that
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall)
(If you are strong you cannot fall)
