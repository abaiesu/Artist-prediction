When we were coming down they said it was too soon
I never had to lie no no no no
when we were coming down, they left us all alone
We're headed nowhere, nowhere. I know you've been around
I feel you in and out, how are you?
Do you sleep? Are you with me?

We used to be unspoken
Now everything is broken
I'm a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son

Arlanda hotel to the bar
Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can buy it out for tonight
Stepping outside for a light
No coke, and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know about photos
Let's go though

How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
That's why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
The coldest dude who can't hold his goose

I'm 'a walk out; wanna walk too?
What about dude?
Fuck him. I just really wanna feel something


It took me like five minutes to figure out what where the voice memos were on the phone
But I figured it out...

Is it real, 'cause you're on-line?
Is it real, 'cause you're on-line?
Is it real, 'cause you're on-line?
Is it real, 'cause you're on-line?

I'm a freaky bitch
I am 5 foot 8. 390
And I am a freaky bitch


Heathen
It's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict
Craftmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Crying 'cause I'm stressed. TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost God, never pray, forgotten us
Lost love, never say, just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait 'til I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D-printed and finish it
Kinison said if you gon' miss heaven...
Why do it by two inches?
Old money and new bitches

Getting next level in a hotel
Ain't shit that we don't need, nigga, oh well
