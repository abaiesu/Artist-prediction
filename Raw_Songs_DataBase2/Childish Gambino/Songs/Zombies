All I see is zombies
Walking all around us
You can hear them coming (they come to take your life)
You can hear them breathing, breathing down your spine

All I see is zombies
Hear them screaming at her
They can smell your money
And they want your soul
Here they come behind you
Try to stay alive


We're coming out to get you
We're oh, so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it


You will find there is no safe place to hide
(That's right, that's right)

All I see is zombies
Feeding all around us
All they eat are people (and you won't survive)
They don't know what happened
They just stay alive


We're coming out to get you
We're oh, so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it


You will find there is no safe place to hide
(That's right, that's right)


We're coming out to get you
We're oh so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it


Do you feel alive, yeah?
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Do-do-do-do-do
Do you feel alive?
