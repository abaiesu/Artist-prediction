Mane, you know what's going, you got cheese, I got dope
For the nine-hunnid strong, I got Ps, I got coke
Mane, you know what's going, you got cheese, I got dope
For the nine-hunnid strong, I got Ps, I got coke (Yeah, yeah)

We work to work, you late to work, I holla, then they send it (Why?)
You know my plot was colder than Chicago in December (Ayy, yeah, yeah)
My bitch came up in Inglewood, her mama was her daddy
And when I'm in the Midwest, she say holla at your family (Holla at me)
My dog pass me that cup (What it do?), taste like candy, bitch (Yeah)
My dog out layin' down the law, ain't breakin' no laws or serving out the rock (Bitch)
Southside still fuckin' in the car, still flippin' in the car, still shootin' out the car (Still shootin' out the car)
Lil' hotbox smokin' our jar, now I'm fuckin' on a star, hold up, I got a call (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Bitches say that I'm a cool cat, fuck that
Tell them bitches I'm a Top Dawg, get shot
Roll the window, let the propane outside
Bunch of niggas doin' donuts (Yeah), yeah
Got the money in a headlock, big dog
Every time we hit the red lights, just shine
It ain't nothin' but a good day, don't die
They ain't teach 'em how to pump fake, big shot (Pat Dawg)

A mill' in the bank, what was I thinkin'?
Pistol in hand, mix with the drankin'
You the big dawg, who is you spankin'?
Police tipped off, them on my door bangin'
Said it was murder but Project is innocent
Laid up with a girl, sippin' on Hennessy
Rap game, mane, sweeter than cinnamon
Put your mob on, who does it benefit?
OG love me 'cause I'm a good earner
Country ride with me now with the burner
I just got out here, a student, a learner
I'm a bread flipper, pancake turner, turner
Cop all them business to dollars
Fly like they swallow, poppin' my collar, turner
Cop all them business to dollars
Fly like they swallow, poppin' my collar, turner

And bitches say that I'm a cool cat, fuck that
Tell them bitches I'm a Top Dawg, get shot
Roll the window, let the propane outside
Bunch of niggas doin' donuts, yeah
Got the money in a headlock, big dog
Every time we hit the red lights, just shine (Yeah)
It ain't nothin' but a good day (Shut the fuck up), don't die (Juicy J, in the building, mane)
They ain't teach 'em how to pump fake, big shot (Let's go)

I'm a big shot
Rollin' weed out a gallon size ziploc
Niggas come through thinkin' that the shit not
They careers over went quicker than a TikTok
We used to slang base like a kickbox
Glock .19, we don't kickbox
I remember when a nigga didn't have time, now a couple hundred thousands on my wristwatch (Bitch)
I'm shinin' (Yes, sir)
Every now and then, gotta remind 'em (Remind 'em)
I got shooters on my team like I signed 'em (Mm-mm)
Say you want smoke, that's all a nigga know
They gon' wipe a nigga nose like a sinus
Starin' at the Rolls Royce roof, tell 'em aim for the stars, lil' nigga, don't settle (Don't settle)
You can never rain on my parade, my cars come with the umbrella
I said, I'm a top dawg, can't match my speed
This a Lamborghini not an SRT
I ain't never met no bitch I need and I never let a broke bitch hit my weed
No way, I'm too high for your bitches, can't locate
Hatin' on me ain't never been okay
I put the squeeze on these niggas like Colgate, let's go

Bitches say that I'm a cool cat, fuck that
Tell them bitches I'm a Top Dawg, get shot (Uh-huh)
Roll the window, let the propane outside (Yes, sir)
Bunch of niggas doin' donuts, yeah (Let's get it)
Got the money in a headlock, big dog (Uh-huh)
Every time we hit the red lights, just shine (You know it)
It ain't nothin' but a good day, don't die (You know it)
They ain't teach 'em how to pump fake, big shot (Let's go)
