You can go to hell, my dear
You'd probably like it better there
With all them boys who thought they could make it
Deadman's curve gonna lay them down

All the things you put me through
Safe to say I'm tired of you
Had our times, yeah we had a few
But where we gonna be when the pills run out

Where we gonna go when the dam breaks loose
And the white line fever gets a hold of you
How we gonna make it to higher ground
If you won't get up and leave

I reckon if I chose to stay
It'd be better for a few more days
But it the end it always rains
And honey, you can cause a storm

But I'm tired and soakin' wet
And hunkered over trying to catch my breath
Broke my back and did my best
To hold you through the shakes

But it's hard to keep floatin' on foundered dream
You're takin' in water at crazy speed
How can I get to the shore on time
If you won't keep afloat

My heart was never much on games
Let alone the ones you play
I've only got one and it's already broken
So why you wanna throw it around

I wish I had the strength to go
But it's a long and hateful road
And I just now got to feelin' at home
And the frost you put on me

Where we gonna go when the dam breaks loose
And the white line fever gets a hold of you
How we gonna make it to higher ground
If you won't get up and leave

And it's hard to keep floatin' on foundered dream
You're takin' in water at crazy speed
How can I get to the shore on time
If you won't keep afloat

You can go to hell, my dear
You'd probably like it better there
With all them boys who thought they could make it
Deadman's curve gonna lay them down
