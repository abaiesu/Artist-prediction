I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love

This love will take us
To the top of every mountain, yeah
And find a pathway through the sky
And lead us to the path alone

This love, I'm talking about this love
This love, I'm talking about this love

This love will open up the door
Straight in to heaven, yeah
And if you want the heaven that we know
The heaven that we'll all get to go

This love, I'm talking about this love
This love, I'm talking about this love

This loving that we've got
Is something good to sing about
This love and there's no denying
I got a love that's flying high as the sky

And all this loving that we feel
Is something that is really real, it's love
And there's no denying, I feel merry
Good and high as the sky

This love, I'm talking about this love
This love, I'm talking about this love

This love, I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love

This loving that we've got
Is mighty good and nice and hot
This love, yeah and there's no denying
I got a love that is flying high as the sky

This love, I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love

This love, I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love
