Whoa (Oh)
Oh (Hmm)
Whoa (Whoa, oh)
Oh (Hmm, yeah)

The stars must be aligned tonight
I believe this has to have a meaning
Lightning had to strike tonight
'Cause the two of us are finally meeting
In this place, at this time
And I feel safe when I look in your eyes
I feel like I know you from another life
And it makes me wish I wasn't so pressed for time

I can't catch my breath 'cause you take it away
For the best writer in town could not find words to say
How there's so many things I wanna get to know
I wish that I could stay, but I gotta go

So I'ma call you tonight
I will, baby, just as soon as I get time alone
I'ma call you tonight
I will, baby, just as soon as I get home

That's the way it goes in life
You get busy when you just don't wanna
There's never enough time, day or night
You have to make it so baby

I'm gonna make a way to connect
'Cause your face is one I can't forget
I feel like I know you from another life
And it makes me wish I wasn't so pressed for time

I can't catch my breath 'cause you take it away
For the best writer in town could not find words to say (Uh-uh)
How there's so many things I wanna get to know
I wish that I could stay (Stay), but I gotta go

So I'ma call you tonight (I promise, baby)
I will baby (I will baby), just as soon as I get time alone
(Soon as I get time alone)
I'ma call you tonight (I'll call ya, baby)
I will baby, just as soon as I get home (Oh)

Destiny, I believe in it
Meant to be, don't you see it's possible
That for this kind of magic, anything can happen
And if you wanna know, then stay by the phone
Just stay by the phone (Oh-oh)

I can't catch my breath (Oh) 'cause you take it away
For the best writer in town could not find words to say
(Not find words to say)
How there's so many things I wanna get to know (To know)
I wish that I could stay (Stay), but I gotta go (I gotta go, baby)

So I'ma call you tonight (Promise I will, promise I will)
I will, baby, just as soon as I get time alone (Oh baby)
I'mma call you tonight (Call you tonight)
I will baby, just as soon as I get home
