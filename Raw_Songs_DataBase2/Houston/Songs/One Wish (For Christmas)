Ooh ooh ooh ooh

If there were no presents
Waiting on Santa's sleigh
What would I wish
For Christmas
And if Frosty, the Snowman
Were melting away
I would pray for hope and unity
On Christmas day

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy and peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one

If Rudolph and his reindeer
Ran into delays
I'd still hope for joy
This season, yeah
And if somehow Santa
Got lost on his way
I would try to find a way to smile
Smile on Christmas day, oh

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy and peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one, oh yeah

You know it ain't about
All those material things, no, no
What you've got to think about
Is the love Christmas brings, yeah yeah

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy and peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one, oh yeah

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy and peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one, oh yeah
