And how do I choose and where do I draw the line
Between truth and necessary pain?
And how do I know and where do I get my belief
That things will be all right again?

What words do I use to try and explain
To those who've witnessed all my tears?
And what does it mean to know all these things
When love's been wasted all these years
When love's been wasted all these years

Standing in the shadows
With my heart right in my hand
Removed from all the people
Who could never understand

I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love
I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love

It's like living in a nightmare
Like looking in the blackest hole
Like standing on the edge of nothing
Completely out of control

Now where have I been all these years
And how come I just couldn't see?
Like a blind man walking around in darkness
I was a pilgrim for your love
I was a pilgrim for your love

Standing in the shadows
With my heart right in my hand
Removed from all the people
Who could never understand

Standing in the shadows
With my heart right in my hand
Removed from all the people
Who could never understand

I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love
I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love

I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love
I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love
