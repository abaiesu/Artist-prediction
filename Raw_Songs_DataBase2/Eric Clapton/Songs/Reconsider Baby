So long
Oh I hate to see you go
So long
Oh I hate to see you go
And the way that I will miss you
I guess you will never know

We've been together so long
To have to separate this way
We've been together so long
To have to separate this way
I'm gonna let you go ahead on now baby
Pray that you'll come back home someday

You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you've changed your mind
You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you've changed your mind
Why don't you reconsider baby?
Give yourself just a little more time
