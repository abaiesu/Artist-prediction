We're that odd couple on our street
Neighbors stare and wonder
We're a man and wife in love
With each other.

Today a friend of mine came by
Said let's do the town
I can't fix you up
With a cutiest thing around.

She's what I was jokin'
When I told him patiently
The only woman that I want
Is waitin' at home for me.

We're that odd couple on our street
Neighbors stare and wonder
We're a man and wife in love
With each other.

A neighbor on our left
Talked with our neighbor on our right
A man across the street
Goes out almost every night.

I've heard a different man each night
Each is life company
They all think we're square
'Cause we're happy as can be.

We're that odd couple on our street
Neighbors stare and wonder
We're a man and wife in love
With each other.

Yes, we're a man and wife
In love with each other...
