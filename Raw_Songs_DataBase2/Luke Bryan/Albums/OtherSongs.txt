// But I Got A Beer In My Hand //

That old familiar, meant to kill ya, middle finger, rear-view mirror
Supposed to make a country boy sad
I should be in my recliner, whiskey typing up one-liners
Crying, trying to get you back
Yeah, I know how that country song goes
I'm supposed to be heartbroke

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high
I ain't got a give in my damn right, I can do this all night
Country done came to town, this town don't stand a chance
I'll holler at the ladies, dancing like crazy, new Luccheses, fresh up out the deer stand
Feeling this high, wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't even gonna try
But I got a beer in my hand

The bands playing David Lee Murphy, party crowd, it's party thirty
Lawdy mercy, I'm feelin good
And I'm bettin' you're bettin', that I'm a wreck and you reckon
I'll call you up any second and I would

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high
I ain't got a give in my damn right, I can do this all night
Country done came to town, this town don't stand a chance
I'll holler at the ladies, dancing like crazy, new Luccheses, fresh up out the deer stand
Feeling this high wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't even gonna try
But I got a beer in my hand

I meant to miss you
Oops, my bad
I meant to be blue

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high
I ain't got a give in my damn right, I'm gon' do this all night
Country done came to town, this town don't stand a chance
I'll holler at the ladies dancing like crazy, new Luccheses, fresh up our the deer stand
Feeling this high wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't even gonna try
But I got a beer in my hand

But I got a beer in my hand
But I got a beer in my hand

// Buy Dirt //

A few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said, what you been up to lately
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said if you want my two cents on making a dollar count

Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks
And the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is
It all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt

Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around
And then he laid it out

Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
And add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks
And the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is
It all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt

You can buy dirt

And thank the good Lord for it
'Cause He ain't makin' any more of it

Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
Watch their pencils marks
And the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is
It all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt

// Chevrolet //

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna find a way to love again
I'm on the winnin' stretch of a losin' end
Foot on the gas, I'm freedom bound
I've got the morning sun at my back, and I'm inspired
Nothing can slow me down
She used to get me.
I was held back by her memory.

[Chorus]
Let the highway sing
A song of a new beginning, keep these wheels a spinnin'.
Gonna hammer down
While the distant sky is wakin', light behind me's breakin.
I found a better way, in the form of a Chevrolet.

[Verse 2]
A strange reminder of how I walked a step behind her
Back here in the shadows of an 18-wheeler
Where I'm headin I still don't know
But I caught the wind of an AM station
Blarin on my radio.
I ain't lookin back.
I never though I could say that. So…

[Chorus]

// Country On //

Hey farm-boy, keep dropping that plow
Bailing that hay, feeding them cows
From the rooster crow till another long day is gone
Country on
Hey big rig, keep clocking them miles
Pulling that horn, making us smile
Rolling that load down the road all night long
Country on

Hey cowboy, keep slinging that rope
Eating that dirt, wearing that gold
Break a leg rodeo, but just don't break no bones
Country on
Hey barkeep, how 'bout another round?
Keep the neon lit in this crazy town
Just pour a little more
Country on

Country on
Yeah
Country on

Hey fireman, boys and girls in blue
We could sure use a lot more like you
You come running in anytime anything goes wrong
Country on
Hey soldier, wherever you might be
Hats off to keeping us free
All our thoughts and prayers till you get back home
Country on

Hey hometown, keep throwing that ball
Raise 'em outside, hang a fish on the wall
They only stay little so long, so love 'em up strong
Country on
I say hey, hey USA
We ain't seen our better days
Hell naw, hey y'all
Country on
Country on

Hey Nashville, keep bending them strings
Digging for gold, chasing them dreams
Keep on with your songs till the whole world's singing along
Country on
I say hey, hey USA
We ain't seen our better days
Hell naw, hey y'all
Country on

Country on and on and on and on and on
Country on and on and on
Country on (Oh, country on)
Keep keeping on and on and on and on and on
Country on and on and on
Country on

Yeah, country on
Woo
Yeah, country on and on and on
On and on
Keep putting that country on
Country on
Country on and on and on and on and on
Country on and on and on
Country on

// Favorite Flowers //

I guess we don't quite understand down here
What makes Him do the things He does
Why some people go so soon
While some grow old
I've learned we're just a step away
And tomorrow might be kind of tough
Nothings promised in this life
All you can do is believe

[Chorus]
So it must have been the way the sunlight hit you
And shined upon your face
Or how the rain would find you 
On the driest of days
Your smile in the morning 
The way you'd reach for the sky
How you danced in the breeze
As people walked by
So it must be true
What I once heard
God picks His favorite flowers first

I bet He put you in his window sill
Looking out over this big old world
And I know Heaven sure does love
Having you around
In His eyes we're all the same
But I just gotta think when He saw you
And how perfect and pretty you were
He just couldn't wait

[Chorus]

Yeah it must have been the way the sunlight hit you
And shined upon your face
Or how the rain would find you 
On the driest of days
Your smile in the morning
The way you'd reach for the sky
How you danced in the breeze
As people walked by
So it must be true
What I once heard
God picks His favorite flowers first

Yeah it must be true
What I once heard

God picks His favorite
God picks His favorite
Flowers first

// Five O'Clock Angel //

[Verse 1]
Every morning of everyday
I wake up; it's the same ole thing
Fight the traffic, punch the clock.
Concrete floors wearing out my shoes
Tired of feeling the way I do.
Three more trucks to load, it never stops.
There killing me from nine to five
When it's quitting time, I come alive.

[Chorus]

Cause I gotta woman
Who holds me in her arms and understands.
A beautiful woman
Who knows how hard it is to be a man.
No telling where I'd be right now
If she hadn't been sent down
So I don't have to face this world all by myself
She's my five o'clock angel.

[Verse 2]
Like a branded man down where I work
The company name sewn on my shirt
They can buy my time, but they don't own me.
There's more to me than what I do
I've got feelings, too.
There somewhere else I'd rather be.
You can have your beer and whiskey sour.
I don't need no Happy Hour.

[Chorus]

No telling where I'd be right now
If she hadn't been sent down
So I don't have to face this world all by myself
She's my five o'clock angel.
My five o'clock angel.

// Good Directions //

[Verse 1:]
I was sittin' there, sellin' turnips on a flat-bed truck
Crunchin' on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinkin' this is where rednecks come from.
She had HOLLYWOOD written on her license plate
She was lost and lookin' for the Interstate.
Needin' directions and I was the man for the job.

[Chorus 1:]
I told her, "Way up yonder past the caution lights
There's a little country store with an old COKE sign.
You gotta stop and ask Miss Beth
For some of her sweet tea.
Then a left will take you to the Interstate,
But a right will bring you right back here to me."

[Verse 2:]
I was sitting there, thinking 'bout her pretty face,
Kicking myself for not catchin' her name.
I threw my hat, said, "You fool, there goes love."
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down.
She probably didn't like me anyhow.
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust.

[Chorus 1]

Is this Georgia heat playin' tricks on me,
Or am I really seein' what I think I see.
The woman of my dreams comin' back to me, yeah.

[Chorus 2:]
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but somethin' felt right.
When she stopped in and asked Miss Beth
For some of her sweet tea.
Mamma gave her a big ole glass
And sent her right back here to me.
Thank God for good directions and turnip greens.

// I Don't Know If I Can Do That //

I'm not supposed to wanna love you no more
No more cards and flowers, no more knocks on your door
Just forget the perfect love that we had, but I don't know if I can do that
I was so certain baby you were the one, that this was it and all my searchin' was done
I should admit you're gone, get used to the facts
but I don't know if I can do that, I don't know if I can do that

I don't know how I'll ever let you go
Since you walked out, there's so much I don't know

The things I'm feelin' they just won't go away
I see you out and I don't know what to say
My friends all tell me that I oughta be glad
but I don't know if I can do that, I don't know if I can do that

I don't know how I'll ever let you go
Since you walked out, there's so much I don't
So much I don't know

Someday, somebody will really love me
And she'll be everything I thought you would be
And all I wanna do is love her back
But I don't know if I can do that, I don't know if I can do that

// Kind Of Pretty I Like //

That little wrinkle in her smile still drives me crazy
I get a chill on my skin when she whispers "baby"
It don't matter what she's doin' or what she's wearin'
I'm just sittin' there staring

She's the perfect kinda pretty I like
The way her hair falls down and lands just right
From her head to her toes, man all I know is I can't get enough
I don't know what it is about me that got right here
I just know I'm gonna hold on tight...
Lay here in love with her all night
Cuz she's the perfect kind of pretty I like

The way that second glass of wine gets her talkin'
How her hair on my shoulder keeps me fallin'
When she's messin' with the radio in my truck
Everything she does just tears me up

She's the perfect kinda pretty I like
The way her hair falls down and lands just right
From her head to her toes, man all I know is I can't get enough
I don't know what it is about me that got right here
I just know I'm gonna hold on tight...
Lay here in love with her all night
Cuz she's the perfect kind of pretty I like

Cuz she's the perfect kinda pretty I like
The way her hair falls down and lands just right
From her head to her toes, man all I know is I can't get enough
I don't know what it is about me that got right here
I just know I'm gonna hold on tight...
Lay here in love with her all night
Cuz she's the perfect kind of pretty I like
Lay here in love with her all night
Cuz she's the perfect kind of pretty I like

// O Holy Night //

O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, o holy night

Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, o holy night

// Prayin' In A Deer Stand //

I think I read somewhere in the Good Book, says He's everywhere
Up in this tree with the wind and the leaves, yeah, it all seems so clear
When your phones in the truck, and you're camo'd up, and your mind's just running free
It might look like hunting, but it's way more than that to me

I do my prayin' in a deer stand
On my back forty church
Thinkin' about life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my heaven on earth
Me and God in a cornfield
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods
'Cause here I am, prayin' in a deer stand

Some find it on a pier where they used to fish with their old man
Some feel it when the choir sings and that light hits that stained glass
We're all down here searching for an answer or a sign
The way those clouds are moving in, I think He's hearing me just fine

I do my prayin' in a deer stand
On my back forty church
Thinkin' about life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my heaven on earth
Me and God in a cornfield
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods
'Cause here I am, prayin' in a deer stand
Prayin' in a deer stand

My boots back on the ground, my head back right
You got your ways of getting through, I got mine

I do my prayin' in a deer stand
Out on my back forty church
Thinkin' about life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my heaven on earth
Me and God in a cornfield
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods
'Cause here I am, prayin' in a deer stand
Prayin' in a deer stand

// Small Town Favorite //

[Verse 1]
How do you turn a scholarship down,
Tear up a ticket, already punched,
And watch a dream die?
Who's gonna tell me how
To face Daddy
And watch Momma cry?
Have I thrown my future away?
Played my last football game?
It all seems so strange
How in just one night
Your whole life can change.

[Chorus]
Wish this old John Deere had wings
And this cotton row was an airstrip
Straight outta here.
Wish this high noon Georgia sun
Could melt what's been done
Make it disappear.
If I could leave, I'd be gone,
But that's just one more thing done wrong
By this small town favorite son.

[Verse 2]
By fall they're all gonna know
Our little secret
My baby holds inside.
By then she'll be startin' to show,
And I'll be the husband
To a shotgun bride.
I already miss that sound
The marching bands and the cheering crowds.
Stuck here in this red dirt ground
Knowin' I, I let everybody down.

[Chorus]

That high noon Georgia sun
Can't melt what's been done.
Girl, I'll be right here
I don't know much about life
But I know what's right
For this small town favorite son.

// Songs You Never Heard //

I heard "Run" on the radio, yesterday
Got me thinking 'bout, how much you love George Strait
But by the time the airwaves ever played that song
You were already gone, you were already home

And there ain't no one that sounds like Whitley
But I'd bet you find something you'd sing with me
We weren't just

Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A lot about living, a little 'bout love
Time marches on, there's a lot of new
Music and memories we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard

Everything sounded better with the windows down
In your Silverado, rolling 'round that two lane town
Now there's a few more ball caps, a few less cowboy hats
But we're still singing 'bout dirt roads
I think you'd be okay with that

And I'm thinking about the way you would've acted
The first time you ever heard "In Color"
Man, it makes me wanna go back
When we were just

Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A lot about living, a little 'bout love
Time marches on, there's a lot of new
Music and memories we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard

You'd be a little off key
Out on the road with me
High fiving my whole band
Mama claims it but we all know
You'd be my number one fan
And we'd be

Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A lot about living, a little 'bout love
Time marches on, there's a lot of new
Music and memories we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard

To songs you never heard

// Stuck On You //

I hear you found one
heard he's a good one
livin out all your dreams
give it some time girl
you'll come to find
you shoulda just stuck with me

when it don't work out
and then he walks out
before you look for number 3
stop for a second
maybe you'll reckon
you shoulda just stuck with me

I know I ain't perfect but least I've learned
I'd do anything for you
you might believe that your over me
but I'm still stuck on you

I keep on hopin'
you had to go just so you could spread your wings
but come some sunrise
you'll come to realize
you shoulda just stuck with me

I know I ain't perfect but least I've learned
I'd do anything for you
you might believe that your over me
but I'm still stuck on you

we're gonna look back
we're gonna laugh bout
our ups and downs and in betweens
when you said goodbye and then you realized
shoulda just stuck with me

give it some time girl
you'll come to find
you shoulda just stuck with me

// Where The Country Girls At //

Where my country girls at
(Mister Worldwide)
Where they at, where they at
(Luke Bryan)
Where my country girls at
(Trace Adkins)
Where they at, where they at
(This a classic)
Where my country girls at
(Let's go!)

Got the mud off my boots
I got the smell good on
Got the truck shined up
See yourself in the chrome
Cranking that key, about to get gone
Calling all my boys on the phone

Where the country girls at
Where they gon be
The ones that like to dance
Ones that like to drink
Every homegrown 10
Downhome pretty
Holla on back
Hit me with your 20
Where they're swinging them jeans
To a hillbilly track
Put me smack dab
In the middle of that
Drop a pin on the map
Get me there fast
Where the country girls at

Where's my Alabama red
Where's my Tennessee wild
Talking Tallahassee legs
I need a Georgia peach smile
New York City, California coast
Somebody let a brother know

Where the country girls at
Where they gon be
The ones that like to dance
Ones that like to drink
Every homegrown 10
Downhome pretty
Holla on back
Hit me with your 20
Where they're swinging them jeans
To a hillbilly track
Put me smack dab
In the middle of that
Drop a pin on the map
Get me there fast
Where the country girls at

(Where they at? Let's go!)

(Hey ho)
(Oh where are you, baby?
(Hey ho)

Yeah I'm talkin'
Parking lot, dive bar
Keg party, old barn
All I know is I wanna go
(Hit 'em, Pitbull)

I'm at the NASCAR epicenter Daytona 500
Grand marshal track house represent (Daniel Suárez!)
White cones at the stage, I'm in the suite
Next to the greatest of all time, baby, MJ (twenty-three)
Blake Shelton, Tim McGraw, show me love
Trace Adkins, Pitbull, Luke Bryan, throw 'em up
Now where my country girls at? With their Daisy Daisy Dukes
Cowboy boots and their cowboys hats, I said
Now where my country girls at? With their Daisy Daisy Dukes
Cowboy boots and their cowboys hats

Where the country girls at
Where they gon be
The ones that like to dance
Ones that like to drink
Every homegrown 10
Downhome pretty
Holla on back
Hit me with your 20
Where they're swinging them jeans
To a hillbilly track
Put me smack dab
In the middle of that
Drop a pin on the map
Get me there fast
Where the country girls at
Yeah, drop a pin on the map
Get me there fast
Where the country girls at

(Where my country girls at)
(Hey hey hey hey)
(Where they at)
Where the country girls at
(Where my country girls at)
Where the country girls at
(Hey hey hey hey)
Got a little brother low
The ones that like to hunt
The ones that like to fish
The ones that like to shake it to a song like this
Where the country girls at
(Hey hey hey hey)
(Where they at)

// Ya'll Can Have This Town //

[Verse 1]
One pool hall and a rundown cotton gin.
"Come Back Soon" hand painted on a grain bin.
We got a hardware store at the intersection,
Dirt roads runnin' in all directions.
I love this place.
But I gotta go,
Cause she is gone.

[Chorus]
Ya'll can have this town
And what I don't grab on my way out.
Cause the only thing I need
Ain't here. She's gone and found her way
To another life in a better place.
But I hear she's missin' me.
Ya'll can have this town.

[Verse 2]
Bet there ain't a single place to fish up there.
No small talk or sweet tea, but I don't care.
It's gonna be worth every thing I have to leave
When I feel her loving arms on me.
Right there's the Interstate.
And I'm turnin' on.
Looks like I'm gone.

[Chorus]

Everybody says I'll be back,
Brother don't hold your breath on that
Cause as long as she ain't here.

[Chorus 2]
Ya'll can have this town
And what I don't grab on my way out.
Cause the only thing I need
Ain't here. She's gone and found her way
To another life in a better place.
But I hear she's missin' me
Ya'll can have this town.

// Your Goodbye Wasn't Good Enough //

[Verse 1]
Standin' right there, awake and aware,
I heard the words right off your lips.
The meanin' was clear, I saw the tears,
But somehow the message didn't click.
The losin' you part, the break in my heart, just didn't stick.

[Chorus 1]
Girl your, goodbye wasn't good enough.
I'm as in to you as I ever was.
If you'd a done it right, then why ain't I the love.
Must be because, your goodbye wasn't good enough.

[Verse 2]
Some look in your eye, says there's still time,
Maybe there's one more last chance left.
What you didn't say, when you turned away,
Made me hang on by one more thread.
That shadow of hope, that whisper of smoke, is still in my head.

[Chorus 2]
Girl your, goodbye wasn't good enough.
I'm as in to you as I ever was.
If you'd a done it right, then why ain't I the love.
Must be because, your goodbye wasn't

Good enough to make me see, I don't need you, and you don't need me.

[Chorus 1]
