Yeah, gotta believe us
Super

Head full of smoke
Body full of ink
I don't measure it no more, I pour it 'til it's pink
As I'm lifting up the doors, droppin' ashes on the seats
I ain't barely reach my peak, no
I ain't barely reach my peak, no
I ain't barely reach my peak
As I'm lifting up the doors, droppin' ashes on the seats (whoa)
I ain't barely reach my peak, no


My baby mama finna get her masters (bravo!)
I just hit the office, that's the FAFSA (line up)
I don't wanna hear about no masters (no, no)
I just hit my pastor, it's faster
They gon' point to Cuba when I pass away
I probably still be ballin' on my Cast Away
I just got a text that say keep goin' (alright, alright)
I just got a check that say keep goin'
Hurricane Jericho, born-bred Crane mode
Everything player code, phone airplane mode (alright alright)
Nothing come for free, nothing come for free
You might be the devil, you don't fuck with me
I'ma keep makin', I make extra payments
I'm a free agent like the second Matrix
I'mma make them nations deal us reparations
Been dancing round the town like I was Kevin Bacon
I be doing shit they only think about
I might throw a milli in the Chase account
Nothing come for free, nothing come for free
You might be the feds, you don't fuck with me


Head full of smoke
Body full of ink
I don't measure it no more, I pour it 'til it's pink
As I'm lifting up the doors, droppin' ashes on the seat, oh
I ain't barely reach my peak, no
I ain't barely reach my peak, no
I ain't barely reach my peak
As I'm lifting up the doors, droppin' ashes on the seat, oh
I ain't barely reach my peak, no


I just went on tour an' got a check to do some shit I love
Call up L.A. Reid and tell his ass it's time to run it up
Doin' all this countin' my own I need some new thumbs
I heard they say they gon' do something to me, tell 'em "do something"
Live nation checks with my name give me goosebumps
I'll book a flight for your girl and make your boo cum
Slide on the prey in a day and make the news come
I had a few fights for my life and I ain't lose one
Nothing come for free, nothing come for free
When I'm with your spouse, she gon' cum for me
You don't want no problems, they go down for me
We can ball and kick it, come and pump with me, ah


Head full of smoke
Body full of ink
I don't measure it no more, I pour it 'til it's pink
As I'm lifting up the doors, droppin' ashes on the seat, oh
I ain't barely reach my peak, no
I ain't barely reach my peak, no
I ain't barely reach my peak
As I'm lifting up the doors, droppin' ashes on the seat, oh
I ain't barely reach my peak, no
