Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

I can spare a rib to get my baby back
I just wanna fall asleep with my baby, yeah
So I don't wake up wonder where my baby at
I wonder if we'd make it back
I wonder can I pay her back, be her baby dad
65th and Ingleside
Way before Jaime got his jingles right
I was sleeping with you every single night
But I was still tryna act single right
65th and Ingleside
I was stacking chips like bingo night
I didn't have to pay for a single light
So I'ma make sure everything go right

Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know anyway not a no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

Your sister owned the house we lived in
On the east side that you rented
Little two flat, inexpensive
I didn't have a glove to pitch in
I didn't have a pot to piss in
Not to mention Ingle city
Not a lot of jobs with pensions
All my raps was bout suspension
Then one day Donald took me on tour
Young broke Chano ain't broke no more
Thought you wouldn't want me come and knock on your doorstep
But I still haven't given you what's yours yet
65th & Ingleside
Moved downtown for a single life
None of my stars ever twinkled bright
'Till God decide to come bring you by

Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

Where's the return on investment?
My friends saying 'Nah! '
That shit was played unless you were here playing the car
We hit the Shell station, I tell you stay in the car
Back in the spot, don't put it in park
Leave that bitch running in case I come running
And skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, grab the gold scar
Better get late 'for it's dark
Kensli couldn't play in the park
Now she can play in the stars
High rise, eye to eye with firework
So high your ears fire, they might've burst
Every time they buy a verse, I buy a purse
But you can't buy back time, it's just not how it works
Three jobs, you afforded the crib
Fuck child support, you supported the kid
A full rack a month, nothing short of my rib
So you first up, go and order a dib
My big homie told me "Nigga growth and development
Go and settle down, don't settle for settlement"
She got you closer to God than you two ever been
She moved over from Evanston, you moved over from Eggleston
First lady you knew you came there
Got shit sunny now you can't share
New Dad step in you can't stare
You know the power in a woman that could lead you in prayer
On 65th & Ingleside
Feel like you can remember every single lie
Truth is I just really need your finger size
So I can make sure they make the ring so tight

Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay
