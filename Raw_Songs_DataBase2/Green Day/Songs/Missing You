Waking up, feeling naked
In my clothes, inside a room that's vacant
Lost my nerve, and it's un-nerving
I know there is something I'm forgetting

Oh, I searched the moon, I lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the street
I'm pounding the pavement, looking

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around
And I'm a complete disaster
I'm missing you

Remember, was the first time (First time)
I told you I loved you at the bus station
Don't forget, 'cause it's not over (Over)
I'm not lost, 'cause I'm just missing you

I searched the moon, I lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the street
I'm pounding the pavement, looking

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around
And I'm a complete disaster
I'm missing you... Say hey!

Well she's my blood, well she's my soul
I get so lost out in the cold
Feels so far, like this lone star
It gets so hard when I'm missing you

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around
And I'm a fucking disaster
I'm missing you
