You're stuck in my head
Stuck on my heart
Stuck in my body, body
I wanna go
Get outta here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you, ooh

This is the part
You gotta say
All that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag
Leaving tonight
While everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out

Up in the clouds
High as a kite
Over the city, city
We never sleep
We never try
When you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh
(Be there with you)

Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out

Hold on to me, I never wanna let you go, ohh
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold, ohh
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold
Ohh, ohh

Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Baby
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold
