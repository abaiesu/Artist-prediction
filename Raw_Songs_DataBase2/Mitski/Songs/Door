There is a door to me
I've never seen it
Sometimes I get closer to it
But I've never found it
At twilight, I almost had it
But then the night fell
I looked out at the dark and wondered
How could I have lost it?

Then, one night, at the park I saw it
With my cheek in the dirt
I couldn't move underneath the dark
But at least I finally found it
Cried out a creak and opened
To show me what's beyond it
A hopeless violence
I named it "love"
