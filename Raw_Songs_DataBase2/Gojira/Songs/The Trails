All that you see that is gold is truly gold
I spotted through the vines, a deer in the wild

Signs in the trails
Beyond the reason

Eye-gazing the unknown, defeating the ground
This passage through the flames, leads me where the souls go

Signs in the dreams
Beyond the reason
We're forced into the light

How can we be so blind?
Our light is torn
How can we be so lame?
No truth being told

Signs in the trails
Beyond the reason

All that you see that lives truly is alive
Let us stay awake reminded of the trails that matter
