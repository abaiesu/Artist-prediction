Surrender to the grind
Embrace the laws that make you cringe
You will be fixed in no time
If you go all the way

Grind!
Grind!

We're wandering in chaos
Forget about which reality is real
Eternal quest to resolve
Our struggle with gravity

You're all shredded, you're all scarred
Fighting the tide
Your tough face on, you think you'll last long
Against the grain?

Go!
Surrender to the grind
Obey!
Surrender to the grind

The only way
Grind!
Grind!
Grind!
