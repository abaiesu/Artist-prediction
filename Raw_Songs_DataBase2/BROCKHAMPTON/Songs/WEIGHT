They split my world into pieces, I ain't heard from my nieces
I've been feeling defeated, like I'm the worst in the boyband
I ain't sleep in some weekends, tryna headline both weekends
Leave my niggas y'all sheepin', I keep the world in my hands
I know accounts should be deleted
I know some niggas should stop hitting my phone
Whenever they needing money or favors done
'Cause I'm still worried 'bout
When Ashlan finna put the razor down
So I don't really give a fuck about a story they done spun
And I ain't done
And I ain't done, ya heard me?

I really miss the old days before the cosigns
I really miss them cold days before the road signs
I really miss when I ain't know which way I was supposed to head
And I was pressed because my shorty gave me cold signs
I was writing poems 'bout a dog and study hall
And she was mad cause I never wanna show her off
And every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft
I thought I had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow screaming

I don't wanna waste no more time
I'm ready to go
I live my life on standby
I can leave you alone

'Cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
Life is a dish served cold most times
And all my life I've taken handfuls, force-fed by the hand that feeds us
But not all hands created equal
I stand by waiting for something good to come
In due time, the skies will split for the sun to smile

My mother called me today
She said she thought she felt my energy a country away
I apologized for not calling enough due to weight
But couldn't tell you if I kept it in my head to decay
I asked her, "Why this world love echoing hate?"
She said, "Don't let up soon'll start dictating your fate"
I think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks
Condition to 'em let the mental our foundation will shake
There's no debate the road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
And recognize them wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
Don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you a jewel
This world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
Sometimes you've gotta step away and check your own intentions
And analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
If people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
You never needed them if they make you another villain (Pressure)

They tried to take the bike
And they took my friend's bike
And then friend was gonna get it back
But then he didn't get it back
And then we had to go to the police station
And then um then some (Pressure)
A random stranger brought back his bike
We just you know, and we didn't tell our mom
So we got in trouble (Pressure makes me)
Because they found out like a day later
Do you want to start the game again?

Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Pressure makes, Pressure makes, Pressu-
Wish I could, Wish I could, Wish I-
I can't take, I can't take, I can't-
Makes me wish, Makes me wish, Makes me-
Pressure makes, Pressure makes, Pressu-
Wish I could, Wish I could, Wish I-
I can't take, I can't take, I can't-
Makes me wish, Makes me wish, Makes me-
Sippin' on my pain, smokin' on my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Sippin' on my pain, smokin' on my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Sippin on my, (sipping on my), smokin' on my (smokin' on my)
Ingestin' my (ingestin' my), I just wanna (I just wanna)
Sippin on my, (sipping on my), smokin' on my (smokin' on my)
Ingestin' my (ingestin' my), I just wanna (I just wanna)
