(So I built you a house)
Tryna find revenge in the dark, I think I know where you went
Tryna find your spirit is hard, I think I know how to spend
My weeks are evil, your brother don't want me here
Your family hates me, my parents don't know I'm here
It'd be better if you loved me but he told me love myself and that's true
It'd be nice if you could help me but he told me help myself and that's true
The sky ain't gon' be fixed tonight
I know for sure the sky ain't perfect


I'm swimmin' in a sea of regret
The more I sink I forget how to swim
I try to breathe, I know the feeling too well
Of Fighting myself, I'm losing again
Why am I here? Cold and Alone
The sea ain't a home, but it's still where I lay
And still to this day, bad credit with karma
Lighting blunts underwater
Still ain't goin' too well, so I kept to myself
