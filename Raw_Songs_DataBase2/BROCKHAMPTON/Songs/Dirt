South side brought the wave back
Hair nappy need a wave cap
Same state where Trae at
This the reason for the mothafuckin ASAP
That's MOB nigga
Why ya all dressed up why ya teeth messed up why ya look so lost nigga
Don't get it twisted down in the dirty south all we do is floss nigga
That shit late
Boss nigga
That one me
Ain't got time can't no nigga take mine
Our shit yall shit lose it no way
I'm off it I'm off it I'm off and dreamin bout it
I'm nauseous I'm nauseous it hurts to think about it ahhh


I've been riding round' with my people
And I always put it down for my people
She ain't ever caught them southern feels
But she gone' catch them southern feels
Because I get it while it's hot, I get it non stop as I watch that body rock
Swanging through town, banging through town, let me slow it down as I get my money right
Got this ice on my wrist candy painted Lexus finna' hit a lick with my squad
Got a muddy cup of the purple stuff take a puff, get buck feel the southern love


Scumbag from the lonestar state
Come around here, you could be the next nigga on the first 48
Niggas run around with a snub 38
You gotta hold it down and protect your 28s
Because since 18 a nigga had a dream
Of that thang on the spokes
I got my mouth froze
Got them thangs for the low
Who the fuck spoke?
Don't mind my southern drawl
I got a pocket full of stones for all of y'all
If he up, then watch him ball
Plot to make these niggas fall
Shoot through walls
Take their money and their Ki's
And don't come back without it all
Screaming fuck 'em and we ball


I've been riding round' with my people

Sock tan, pack of ports
Dirty bitch, might double cup her
Smokin gas on the porch
Guess you could say I'm burnin rubber
Head is good, so I learn to love her
My dogs talk in numbers
My iPhones got iPhones so all my friends can talk to me
My flip phone even switch lanes
My bitch got that lipstick
Like candy paint, lick it off
Fuck me, then piss me off
Alexis, get my ren on
Alexis, get my ren on
Curve me, curve me
Bitch don't hit my phone, cuz


Heard everything's supposed to be different round here
Gotta make sense of shit round here
It's like everybody wanna hit a lick round here
Guess I gotta stop giving shits round here
Been looking for a sign or some shit round here
Grind hard just to get a fuckin grip round here
We don't sit round here
Big shit round here
You a target if you don't fuckin fit round here
Better charge it to the game nigga
We all going insane better find a fuckin lane
Doing digits in a range nigga
No guts no gain
No pain no fame
We are not one in the same nigga
I could change your whole life
We don't need no hype
Just to get shit lit for the night
We could set it off on a fuck nigga on sight

Pushing weight
Got to educate
Niggas smoking on my scholarship
That's a win win
Allowances off these college kids
Brockhampton thicker than the wayans man
I'm an asshole
Run up in su casa and dun dun dun dun da da dun dun
They deported my uncle
Cause he ain't got the papers to prove it
Mama sent me to that white school (Not black!)
Prove I could speak like them white kids
Act like them white kids
Smoke like them white kids
Fuck that
I'm the all black johnny cash
