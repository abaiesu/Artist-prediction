"You're not free with your Cadillac! You're doing just exactly what the Man wants you to do: Buy his goods, so you'll never have any real economic freedom. He wants you to buy everything he advertises on TV, so he'll keep you perpetually owing your soul to the company store. You're not free, you're a slave!"


Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz


With these superficial people from my past
Dancin' 'round the fact that I did everything the motherfuckers bet against
They be like, "Gather 'round, place your bets
This young man won't ever be shit"
Well my bad, I guess I just pursued this shit
While you chose to settle down to have some kids
I mean, it's okay to fall in line, just don't look back
That's a long-ass line that I'm not in
I just never found the time, or had the chance
Truth is, you can kiss my ass
Never been the one to bow down
Never been the one to air out
Any situation but right now
When it's all your fault, I'm here now


Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz


Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't


Thrift like a five hundred discount
I move it, I move it, like Madagascar
Flip it like eight ball to inside of nose, it get raw
Blood and leaf color like fall
When you were callin', they said I'd be nothing
Well, suck on my dick and then lick on my balls
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Th-th-they want the boot of my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
Look what we did in a year
You need a neutral career
I hate on myself when I look in the mirror
Hear all the voices all up in my ear
Why do I care how I look?
Why do I care what they say?
I do not care what they say


Nowadays everybody wanna talk
They forgot how to listen
'Til the prophets arisen
We mix new edition with nuclear fission
I don't do auditions
I don't ask permission, ain't no politician
Don't ask my opinion, you got an addiction
To what ain't your business
Make the admission, I make like magicians
And hit my Houdini
Why they so soft like linguine?
I murder this music routinely
I know that you see me
Don't see you search for the meaning
I think that's why you ain't believing
The future is leaning
Revolutions started streaming
The reason why you see me beaming
I'm dreaming
Of making moves like the government
You better think about who you fuckin' with
Get back


Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't


Won't you come this close to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (free)
Oh yeah
Won't you come this close to me
Baby baby baby yeah


And if I could erase, who you thought I was
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
And if I could erase, who you thought I was
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
