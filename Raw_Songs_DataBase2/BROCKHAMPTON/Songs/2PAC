I got some demons on me
They been feeding on me
When I sold prescriptions
And my pill addiction
Fuck the damn detectives
Mama called the Reverend
I know she praying for me
But I'm in the shadows
Hella drugs and ammo
Kicking doors my MO
I got some bad habits
I do some shit I shouldn't
My life is on a scale
I know there's angels on me
All my dead homies
I know they waiting on me
Selling dope from out ya house
I know you praying for me
I know you used to trust me
I miss the chicken nuggets
And the kisses from her
Damn I miss you momma


Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me
Shadow keep following me
Trouble keep following me
