I'm sorta back
I'll quarter back yo side chick
Hut hut one hike bitch
Don't hide her I'll find it
Hit it once then rewind it
Hit it twice then get blinded
We get blunted
I don't trust em
And I don't act like I love em
I finally finish, she finally famous
I finally did it I found me a stranger, I took her to dinner
And then I got in it I told her she ain't shit and then she replaced me
With some other nigga, she told me she hate how I roll
Better than taking this chick on the road
Better than taking this chick to my show
Get straight, keep pace or keep space from my face
No taste, a lot of ladies is 6th place, type to get misplaced drunk and throwed
Shawty was getting old, and she ain't know that I was cold
And she always wanted more
Click clack boom bap goes the beat
When I can't keep shawty on her feet


No more tears
No more fears
No more years, to waste on thoughts unclear


I don't need you, I don't one I need some more
Treat me so bad, fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero baby
You need a hero, you need a hero baby


You can't wait for love that shit don't last forever
I can't wait for you that shit don't last forever
I know you well know you better than yourself
Know your ins and outs and curves you swerving straight into your house
You know my name
Say my name touch yourself we got issues
Know your frame
Know your game we got issues
Know I'm lame
Know you same we got issues
Keep it strange
No to blame
Fuck you and your shit
Swear you burn like matches tip
Swear you fucked like half these kids
How to love on such a bitch
Shoulda fucked up on your cousin
She look good even with black eyes
Next time that you say you love me baby I'll just ask why ya here


No more tears
No more fears
No more years, to waste on thoughts unclear


I don't need you, I don't one I need some more
Treat me so, bad fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero baby
You need a hero, you need a hero baby


She put her whole spirit in it
She put her whole spirit in it
She run around and keep her whole spirit in it
She put her whole spirit in it
She turn around she let the whole squad hit it
She let the whole squad hit it
She turn around she let the whole squad hit it
She let the whole squad hit it
Ain't that a bitch?
Face down that bitch
She turn around disrespect that bitch
Ain't that a bitch?
Face down that bitch
She turn around disrespect that bitch
