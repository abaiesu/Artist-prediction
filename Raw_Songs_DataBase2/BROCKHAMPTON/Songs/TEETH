I done been in trouble, 'bout as long as I remember
My momma tried to help me, but I hardly ever listened
So she sent me to them white schools, I learned that I was different
They told me I'm a nigga, well now I know I am
I got my finger on the trigger, I'm a project baby
A free lunch felon, and I'm hungry every minute
Empty stomach, weed smoke can't fill it
If you don't listen to me I set fire to the building
Need to listen to the children
And the weapons they concealing
Hear the voices of a million when I sell my first million
I am bound to go diamond ain't no luck or suprises
I am tanning on an island
I can feel the pressure but I see my new horizons
Me and all my niggas getting stars down on Sunset Boulevard
But niggas from the South Side with xan-bars and gun play
Niggas on that 'some day'
If you shooting for the stars you only headed one way
