Me llamo Roberto
Y esta es mi familia


This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine


Better not, better not, better not
Get too dark please
You should call, you should call, you should call
On me to eat
Even when, even when, even when
Night skies bug me


This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war

This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine


I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah
I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah


Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy
It's so mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy
