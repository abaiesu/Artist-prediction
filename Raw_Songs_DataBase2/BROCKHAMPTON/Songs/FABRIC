Take it all or leave it

I can't sleep like I used to
The world will try to tell you who are before you get to
Explain yourself, your thoughts, your motives, and all your reasons
Two albums every season
What the hell do ya'll believe in?
Why the hell do ya'll keep reachin'?
In the evenings when I see them
I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving
Need something new to believe in
'Cus these new niggas are changing
I mean they change on you
Why the hell the BBC only writes about me when it comes down to controversy?
What about three CDs in one year with no label
And we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable
I was a nigga in a room with no motherfuckin' cable
And no table
Now my mom call me whenever she needs her car, no, cellphone, whatever bill paid too
Y'all niggas lose
You understand why I do what I do, so let me do it
Get the hell out, let me do it
Get the hell out, let me do it

I don't speak like I used to
I'm thinking of a way to change the world that I move through
I feel like Nikola, what I invented's what I'm true to
I feel for Nikola with these ideas that I grew through
I know that when they see you blow your mind, they'll just abuse you
I started feelin' restless nights, I'm scared that I'm delusional
I'm scared that I'm more like Nikola than I'd ever collude to
I'm scared of what can happen when ideas would consume you
'Cause there isn't room for peace I can achieve

You don't understand why I can't get out up and shout
I keep tellin' you
You don't understand why I can't get out up and shout

Stay off
Keep off
Get out
Hey boy
Stay off
Get buff
Get out
The monsters swarm around with them toys
The monsters swarm around with them toys

Keep off
Stay off
Keep off
Get out
Hey boy
Stay off
Get buff
Get out
The monsters swarm around with them toys
The monsters swarm around with them toys

Don't mind me I'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)
But if you got a lifeline
Throw it, throw it
Don't mind me I'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)
But if you got a lifeline
Throw it, throw it

Why the fuck would you share this shit with these people
I don't know these people
I don't know you either no more
I'm at war with myself
Every time I see this shit I wanna kill myself
And they coming for my mother sending bullets for my head
And they foolin' me nah but I'd rather be dead
Please just leave me alone, I don't wanna be read
Yeah-ah

You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' you
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' you
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' you
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' you
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout

It's the best years of our lives, motherfucker
 got to experience
These are the best years of our lives
I feel you
