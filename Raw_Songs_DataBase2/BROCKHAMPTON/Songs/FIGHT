My male role models drug dealers and thugs
My father learned how to solve problems with guns
And when I grew up I learned what racism was
And what teaching it does
And like my teachers would say
"Little black boys have a place in the world"
Like hanging from trees
Or dead in the street like I seen on TV
All them boys they killed, they looked just like me
Not like Brandon or Chandler, but Malik and Kareem
I was born with a target, and it stuck to my skin
And I learned in social studies I was one of them men
Who were locked in the chains, but not locked in the pen
But I'm bigger than that, I'm the beginning and end


I'm the sun and the moon
I'm the light and the dark
I am life in the tomb
I'm the pharaoh and slave
Gentrifying my spirit
It's like a knife in the womb
Refuse to act like a parrot
Or to dance like a monkey
See your stance is apparent
That's why I'm here for the money
Don't care to cater to Mary
I'm fetishizing my spirit
I see your culture's dependent
On what you didn't inherit
Won't let my world be attempted
I'm staying distant


Who gonna be the reason why I get high
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped
Who gonna be the reason why I get high
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped
Who gonna be the reason why I get high
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped
Who gonna be the reason why I get high
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped
