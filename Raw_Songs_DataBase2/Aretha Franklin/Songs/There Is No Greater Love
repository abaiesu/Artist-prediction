There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love
No heart so true
There is no greater thrill
Than just what you bring to me
No, no sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me

You're, you're the sweetest thing
That I, I have ever known, mhm
And to think, just to think that
You are mine, you are mine alone

There is, there is no greater love
In all the world, in all the world, it's true, ooh hoo
No greater love
Than just what I feel for you

You're, you're the sweetest thing
That I have ever, ever known
And to think that you are mine
You're mine all alone, all alone

There is no, no greater love
In all the world, all the world, and it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel, what I feel for you
Ooh hoo, yeah, no greater love
Than just what I feel for you, ooh hoo
For you
