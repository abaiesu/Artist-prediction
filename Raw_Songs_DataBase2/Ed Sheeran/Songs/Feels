(Bada boom bada bing, you'll knock me right off of my feet)

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's something real
Something real
I got the feels, yeah (Bada boom bada bing, you'll knock me right off of my feet)
I've waited most my life for something real
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Drop it to the ground, leave your hand in the sky, baby
No head, no nothing, gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in a cloud, baby
Baby, I got that feeling
Don't know why you do this to me
I try to tell 'em not to do it, it's loud
I try to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap till we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the ride, bus
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's something real
Something real
I got the feels, yeah
I've waited most my life for something real
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Used to be playboy, heartbreaker
But for you, I travel 1,000 acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers (Alright)
One day we get married in Las Vegas
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin
This love give you protein and vitamins
See you wiggling, jiggling
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon?
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothing like anything I ever really seen
You give me this feel if you know what I mean

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Bada boom bada bing, you'll knock me right off of my feet
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
I've waited most my life for something real
Baby, I got the feels for ya
