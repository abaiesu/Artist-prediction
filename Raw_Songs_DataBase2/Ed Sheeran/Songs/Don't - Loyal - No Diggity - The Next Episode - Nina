I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned, I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing
Ah lahmlahlah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How? I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lahmlahlah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

(knock, knock, knock)
on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lahmlahlah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

these girls ain't loyal
that heart is soo cold
this girl ain't loyal

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect 10,
I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win

I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up girl)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up

Top Dogg, bite em all, nigga burn the shit up
D-P-G-C my nigga turn that shit up
C-P-T, L-B-C, yeah we hookin back up
And when they bang this in the club baby you got to get up
Thug niggaz drug dealers yeah they givin it up
Lowlife, yo' life, boy we livin it up
Takin chances while we dancin in the party fo' sho'
Slip my hoe a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'
Bitches lookin at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin my hair
Bitch quit talkin, quick walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relievin your stress

La-da-da-da-dahh
It's the motherfuckin D.R.E. (snoop doooooog)
La-da-da-da-dahhh
You know I'm mobbin with the D-O-double-G

eyo eyo eyo eyoooooo

But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And re: stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay

Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I said you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You'd be wearing my hoodie
With draw strings pulled tight
To keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away
We'd only speak on the phone

Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
Then as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish back to the barb with all the Celtics
I disappear
You call me selfish, I understand
But I can't help it
I put my job over everything
Except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
So I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Uh won't you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, go, oh won't you leave me now

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me
Both in a road, won't you leave me now
Now
