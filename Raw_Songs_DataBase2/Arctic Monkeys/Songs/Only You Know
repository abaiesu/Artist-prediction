I want to see something that used to be in your eyes again
I'm waiting to see it you know it's only a question of when
And I know how much I'm missing heaven
You know that its missing

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I want to be there too

I know it's not easy for you to start to believe again
And when the day comes don't let yourself be deceived again
Cause I know how you've been waiting
Such a long time that you've been waiting

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I want to be there too 

And I know how you've been waiting
Such a long time that you've been waiting

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I want to be there too
