Break a mirror
Roll the dice
Run with scissors
Through a chip pan fire fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Find a well known hard man
And start a fight
Wear your shellsuit
On bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Ooh... Yeah yeah yeah 
Ooh... Yeah yeah yeah 


Bite the lightning
And tell me how it tastes
Kung Fu fighting
On your rollerskates
Do the Macarena in the devil's lair
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Ooh... Yeah yeah yeah 
Ooh... Yeah yeah yeah 
Ooh... Yeah yeah yeah
