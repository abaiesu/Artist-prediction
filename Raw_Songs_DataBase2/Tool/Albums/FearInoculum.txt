Album: FearInoculum

// Fear Inoculum //

Immunity, long overdue
Contagion, I exhale you
Naive, I opened up to you
Venom and mania
Now, contagion, I exhale you

The deceiver says, he says
You belong to me
You don't wanna breathe the light of the others
Fear the light, fear the breath
Fear the others for eternity
But I hear them now, inhale the clarity
Hear the venom, the venom in
What you say inoculated
Bless this immunity
Bless this immunity
Bless this immunity

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Enumerate all that I'm to do
Calculating steps away from you
My own mitosis
Growing through division from mania

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Forfeit all control
You poison, you spectacle
Exorcise the spectacle
Exorcise the malady
Exorcise the disparate
Poison for eternity
Purge me and evacuate
The venom and the fear that binds me

Your veil now, lift away
I see you runnin'
Deceiver chased away
A long time comin'

// Pneuma //

We are spirit
Bound to this flesh
We go around one foot nailed down
We're bound to reach out and beyond
This flesh become Pneuma

We are will and wonder
Bound to recall, remember
(We are born of)
One breath, one word
(We are all)
One spark, sun becoming

Child, wake up
Child, release
The light
Wake up now, child, wake up
Child, release
The light
Wake up now, child

(Spirit)
(Spirit)
(Spirit)
(Spirit)

Bound to this flesh
This guise, this mask, this dream
Wake up, remember
(We are born of)
One breath, one word
(We are all)
One spark, sun becoming

Pneuma
Reach out and beyond
Wake up, remember
(We are born of)
One breath, one word
(We are all)
One spark, eyes full of wonder

// Invincible //

Long in tooth and soul
Longing for another win
Lurch into the fray
Weapon out and belly in

Warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Bellow aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am

Beating chest and drums
Beating tired bones again
Age-old battle, mine
Weapon out and belly in

Tales told
Of battles won
Of things we've done
Caligula would grin

Beating tired bones
Tripping through, remember when
Once invincible
Now the armor's wearing thin
Heavy shield down

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Relevant

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Cry aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am
Where I am

Warrior
Struggling
To remain
Relevant

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Tears in my eyes, chasing Ponce de León's phantoms
So filled with hope, I can taste mythical fountains
False hope, perhaps, but the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting, feeling time, bearing down

Tears in my eyes, chasing Ponce de León's phantoms
So filled with hope, I can taste mythical fountains
False hope, perhaps, but the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting, feeling time, bearing down

False hope, perhaps, but the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting, feeling time, bearing down

Bearing down

// Descending //

Free fall through our midnight
This epilogue of our own fable

Heedless in our slumber
Floating nescient we free fall through this boundlessness
This madness of our own making

Falling isn't flying
Floating isn't infinite

Come our end suddenly
All hail our lethargy
Concede suddenly

To the quickened
Dissolution pray
We mitigate the ruin
Calling all to arms and order

Drifting through this boundlessness
This madness of our own making

Sound our dire reveille
Rouse all from our apathy

Lest we cease to be

Stir us from our
Wanton slumber
Mitigate our ruin
Call us all to arms and order

Sound the dread alarm through the primal body
Sound the reveille
To be or not to be

Rise
Stay the grand finale
Stay the reading of our
Swan song and epilogue

One drive to stay alive
Elementary. Muster every fiber
Mobilize
Stay alive

Stir us from our
Wanton slumber
Mitigate our ruin
Call us all to arms and order

// Culling Voices //

Disembodied voices deepen my suspicious tendencies
Conversations we've never had
Imagined interplay
Psychopathy. Don't you dare point that at me

Heated altercations we've never had, so I'm told
Yet guided by them all
Every single one

Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over and over

Judge, condemn, and banish any and everyone
Without evidence
Only the whispers from within

Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over

Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over and over

(Imaginal interplay, Imaginal interplay)
(Psychopathy) Don't you dare point that at me

(Don't you dare point that at me)
(Don't you dare point that at me)
(Don't you dare point that at me)
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you dare point that
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you dare point that at

// 7empest //

(Keep calm, keeping it calm, keep calm. Fuck, here we go again)

Heat lighting flash, but don't blink. Misleading
Tranquility ruse
You're gonna happen again
That's what I think
Follow the evidence
Look it dead in the eye
You are darkness
Trying to lull us in, before the havoc begins, into a dubious state of serenity
Acting all surprised when you're caught in the lie

We know better
It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you
We know your nature

Blame it all on the bastards when you're blowing out
Shame on you
Shame on you now
No amount of wind could begin to cover up your petulant stench and demeanor
Calm as cookies and cream, so it seems
We're not buying your dubious state of serenity
Acting all surprised when you're caught in the lie

We know better
It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you
We know your nature

Calm before the torrent comes
Calm before the torrent comes
Calm before the torrent comes
Calm before the tempest comes to reign all over

Disputing intentions invites devastation
A tempest must be true to its nature
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that

Control, your delusion
Insane and striking at random
Victim of your certainty, and therefore your doubt's not an option
Blameless, the tempest will be just that
So try as you may, feeble, your attempt to atone
Your words to erase all the damage cannot

A tempest must be just that
