Churning through the miseries
I find a tear unshed
This emptiness inside of me
It brings me out for dead

Compulsiveness for self destruction
Impulse led by entropy

I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down, keep sinking down
I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down until these feelings begin to blur

Sunlight falters
As we wait the world goes up in flames
I know we will be the ones
To fill up all these graves

Compulsiveness for self destruction
Impulse led by entropy

I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down, keep sinking down
I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down until these feelings begin to blur

It was all a blur and then it was nothing
It was all a blur and then it was nothing

Churning through the miseries
I find a tear unshed
This emptiness inside of me
It brings me out for dead

Sunlight falters
As we wait the world goes up in flames
I know we will be the ones
To fill up all these graves

I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down, keep sinking down
I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down until these feelings begin to blur

It was all a blur and then it was nothing
It was all a blur and then it was nothing

Nothing
