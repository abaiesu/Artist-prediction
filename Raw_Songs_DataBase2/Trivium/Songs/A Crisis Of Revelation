Banished immortal
Deformed out of recognition
Everything believed in was dead

Floundered in the void
Suffering the constant scourge
Cursed to walk alone amongst the stars

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me

Old ones now emerge
Evil beyond comprehension
Bringing forth the ending of all man

Captive in their stare
Deafening, their voices heard
Anomie, broken by their words

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me

Waiting for all of it to fall
Waiting for all of it to fall

Waiting for all of it to fall
Waiting for all of it to fall

Banished immortal
Deformed out of recognition
Everything believed in was dead

Floundered in the void
Suffering the constant scourge
Cursed to walk alone amongst the stars

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me

Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me
