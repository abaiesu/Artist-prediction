Exaltation
Golden memories, my creation
Devastation
Pain is clarity, lamentations

Run away
So far away
I can't outrun what is coming for me

My temptations
Woken from a dream, deviations

It's all the hate
That my heart beats
Negates my sympathies

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence

Exaltation
Golden memories, my creation
Devastation
Pain is clarity, lamentations

Run away
So far away
I can't outrun what is coming for me

Divination
Foretold prophecies, annihilation

It's all the hate
That my heart beats
Negates my sympathies

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence

Decay
Embrace
Serpent's coil of all our mistakes

Decay
Embrace
Serpent's coil of all our mistakes

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence
