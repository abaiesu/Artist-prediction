Mh, who knew it
I'd have to see you as a threat
Now I just wanna see you less
MTV, I'll be on the next, uh
Yeah, I ain't try to place no blame, ooh
Everything my mom said came, true
She said we'd be better off friends
Now that would make no sense, mmm


You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Be at one, oh

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh

You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're
Right here standin' face to face
You already know, 'ready know, 'ready know
That you won, oh

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect? (oh baby)
But you're not coming home with me tonight, oh no

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new (someone new)

Psh
Yeah, well I guess, uh
You ain't been functioning at your best, uh
Searchin' for attention in my mentions
Like talking shit's the only way to get some, nope
But you can try
Trust me, baby, you ain't gon' be gettin' none of mine
Other niggas maybe but I'm a different design
'Lotta suckers ask so I know you're doin' fine, yeah


You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh (over you)
