The stone thrown at your window
It's telling you to get up and get up and go
And to climb down the shakers of your house
To the back of my Chevy and no one will ever know

We drive around November with one light out
They try to pull us over go right ahead
We'll still drive around to find a place to sleep at
And if can't find one backseats gonna be our bed

Oh Melony I don't believe when you tell me that your seventeen and proud
Cause it says so loud
It's not right to hold you through the night
You put up no fight when I put words in your mouth, oh yea

We drive around November with one light out
They try to pull us over go right ahead
We'll still drive around to find a place to sleep at
And if can't find one backseats gonna be our bed

She ripped off the grass and threw it on my face
I pushed her over laughing right away
She said the moonlight makes the windows in your eyes
Kiss her inside out with no goodbye bye

I remember waking up in the middle of the night
On the brick shear highway
It's not right but oh I can't fight it anymore
Do you remember waking up in the middle of the night
On the brick shear highway
Ohh it's not right yeah I can't fight it anymore

I can't fight
I can't fight it anymore
