Yeah, yeah
See I've been thinkin' lately, baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

I see you walking over there with all your friends
Eyein' me down
But remember what you said to me, to me
We've been on and off for a couple months now
Feeling okay 'bout it all
But baby somehow
You keep coming back to me (leave me)

The last thing I wanna do is leave again and end up bringing you down
And you can't just come around
I don't wanna keep playing these games
I've broken your heart and caused so much pain
And all I've gotta say is

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on (yeah)
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

Girl, even though you do it better than anyone else
Staying with me ain't no good for your health
Made lots of mistakes, so I'm not the only one, don't have to be this way
That way I don't have to explain why
For all it's worth, at least we give it a try
Please believe me, 'cause

The last thing I wanna do is leave again and end up bringing you down
And you can't just come around
I don't wanna keep playing these games
I've broken your heart and caused so much pain
All I've gotta say is

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on (yeah)
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It breaks my heart when you once said that
"You're my one and only
And I'll love you till day is done
You're the one that makes me happy"
God, what have I done?

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on (yeah)
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more (no more, no more)
So it's best that we move on (no more)
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on (yeah)
I don't wanna hurt you baby
