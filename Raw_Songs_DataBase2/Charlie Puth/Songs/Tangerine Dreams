You sing yourself to sleep at night
Melodies behind closed doors
I'm over by the corner
Listening to you from the second floor
I open up the curtains
To hear the thunder and the rain
We dropped off all the flowers
To wash away the pain
Wanna go with you anywhere, anywhere
Wanna go with you anywhere
I'm sorry I kept you waiting
I have no excuse
There's no room for debating
Why it took so long to get back to you
Wanna go with you anywhere
But these tangerine dreams will not go away
Build them right up and mold them out of clay
They just keep me company
Now I take everyday with a deep breath
Cause I found out the hard way when he left
Suffering silently
Wanna go with you anywhere
These last couple days I haven't been myself
Cause I know I won't be seeing you on commonwealth again
Commonwealth again
These last couple days I haven't been myself
Cause I know I won't be seeing you on commonwealth again
Commonwealth again
