Midnight, lock all the doors
Keep playing that song all day
Just the sound of traffic
The patron of you switching lanes
San Diego, Hard Rock hotel
Wondering why I came
I said I'll try not to think of you
If you say you don't feel the same

Ooohh, Ooohh
Ohh, you're reluctant cause you know I'll leave you nothing to see
Ooohh, Ooohh,
I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me

Feels like the end of the world
Right in this new poor town
Ohh, I should have kept quiet
Yeah I should have shut my stupid mouth

The long table
The boomerang
Travelling way down south
And it's ironic cause it's probably the last time that you see me around

Ooohh, Ooohh
Ohh, you're reluctant cause you know I'll leave you nothing to see
Oh yeah
Ooohh, Ooohh,
I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me

I said I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me
