Don't run from me river
Don't run from me river river
No don't run from me river
Don't run from me river river

Look, you can play it cool
Act like you don't care
River don't be cruel
You're pushing me away
Don't want to get hurt
So you hurt me first
With the words you say

Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are looking up

Oh river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Oh river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
From our love (run, run)

Look, darling don't give up
When the water's rough
Where you gonna go?
My heart is your home
Nothing is as cold
As running on your own
So river don't you rush

Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are looking up

Oh river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Oh river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
From our love (run, run)

Don't run from me river
Don't run from me river, river
No don't run from me river
Don't run from me river, river
No don't run from me river
Don't run from me river, river
No don't run from me river

Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are looking up

Oh river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Oh river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
From our love (run, run)

Oh river (river, river) (Don't run from me river)

From our love (run, run) (Don't run from me river, river)
