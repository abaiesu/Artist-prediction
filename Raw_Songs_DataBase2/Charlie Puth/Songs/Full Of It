Does it feel different? Or like it was?
Does he ever send you roses just because
And would he hold you?
All through the night?
Write a half a million songs to make it right

There's no place that I'd rather be
Then when you're here right, next to me

Ooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
When he says you're beautiful
Or is he full of shit?

How many times would
He say goodbye?
All he ever seems to do is make you cry
Do you still think of me
every single day?
Cause our life was comfortable in every way

There's no place that I'd rather be
Then when you're here right, next to me

Ooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
when he says you're beautiful
or is he full of shit?

Ooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
When he says you're beautiful
Or is he full of.

Ooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
When he says you're beautiful
Or is he full of shit?
