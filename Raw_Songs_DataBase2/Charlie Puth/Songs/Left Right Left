Oh I been hurting lately
I'm down on all my luck
Sometimes there's no one there by your side
I don't deserve this baby
But I know I can't give up
Tough times I just take them in stride

Hmmm, I'm almost there, only one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Hmmm, I'm moving on, I got no regrets
Oh, left, right, left, right, left

I said times are changing, tell me how can I keep up
Every time I turn around there's a wall
But I'm climbing daily, until I see the top
And I get up right after every fall
When you're brokenhearted
And you're lost without me
Yeah you gotta walk alone, yeah it's true
Flash every smile cause I've been lost for miles
Cause, yeah, I know you've felt this way before too

Hmmm, we're almost there baby one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Hmmm, we're moving on, we got no regrets
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, we're almost there only one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left

Hmmm...
I know it looks like it's too far
But it's nothing compared to how far we've come
Walking down this boulevard
When the darkest times come right before the sun

We're almost there baby one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
We're moving forward and there's no regrets
Oh, left, right, left, right
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, we're almost there only one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, we're almost there only one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
