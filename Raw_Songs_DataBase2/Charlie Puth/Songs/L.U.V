Stole my heart and I fell for you
Always knew I'd come back for you
Time with you is not wasted time

Hurry for confection
Waiting for perfection
What I got to do to make you mine?

Oh woah
Something about your hope
It's making me want to know
How far I can take it

Oh woah
Don't want to take it slow
Just give it another go and
We can
We can

Give it all
We can give it all
I'll give you that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V

Give it all
You can give it all
Give me that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V

L.U.V
L.U.V
L.U.V
L.U.V

I will sell my soul for you
Put myself through hell for you
Loving you's my only sin

Cutting through the tension
That's my only intention
Just trying to let you let me in

Oh woah
Something about your hope
It's making me want to know
How far I can take it

Oh woah
Don't want to take it slow
Just give it another go and
We can
We can

Give it all
We can give it all
I'll give you that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V

Give it all
You can give it all
Give me that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V

L.U.V
L.U.V
L.U.V
L.U.V

I don't wonder why
Oh who was wrong
Oh
We just need to keep on holding on
Woah

I got a billion stars up above me
Solid on the ground
Baby we ain't got no limits
So tell me are you down
We just need to keep on holding on
Woah


Give it all
We can give it all
Give you that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V

Give it all
You can give it all
Give me that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V

L.U.V
L.U.V
L.U.V
L.U.V
