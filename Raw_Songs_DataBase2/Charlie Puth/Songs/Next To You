Ohh
Doo doo doo doo doo
Right next to you

You're the kind of person I remember seeing before
You're pretty face is one that I'll always adore
You have the eyes that'll close whenever you kiss me
Because love makes us whatever we want to be

How do I breathe?
How do I sleep?
With you not beside me
You're all the things I could not see
But now they're infront of me

When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do
I wanna be next to you
Right next to you
Right next to you

When I saw you on that richside on that one particular day
I was really hoping and wondering if you'd ever look my way
So I got up from my seat but you had already passed me by
If only I got there earlier and not lost in your eyes

How do I breath?
How do I sleep?
With you not beside me
You're all the things I could not see
But now they're infront of me

When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do
I wanna be next to you
Right next to you
Right next to you

I'll promise one I'll be
And maybe one day you'll see
That you belong to me
Baby, baby

I don't know what to do
And it only helps when I'm singing right next to you
Sitting right next to you

Da-da-doooo

When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do
I wanna be next to you
When I'm right next to you
Right next to you

Da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Right next to you...
