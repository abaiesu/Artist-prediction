Yeah
Somebody give me, uh
Somebody give me the answer
Me and you isn't the answer
Me and you isn't
Maybe I'm tellin' myself that
But there ain't nothin' that'll change that
What good would it be, if I knew how you felt about me?

It could've been right but I was wrong
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone
Part of me that cared inside it's gone
And I know, that I can't, get caught up

We could've been
And we tried to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been
Though I'm holding it in
'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been
We could've been
We could've, damn
