You need cooling, baby, I'm not fooling
I'm gonna send you back to schooling
Way down inside, honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you my love

Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

You've been learning, baby, I've been yearning
All them good times, baby, baby, I've been learning
Way, way down inside, honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you my love

Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

You've been cooling, baby, I've been drooling
All the good times baby I've been misusing
Way, way down inside, I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you every inch of my love
Gonna give you my love

Yeah! All right! Let's go

Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

Way down inside... woman... you need... love

Shake for me, girl
I wanna be your backdoor man
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
