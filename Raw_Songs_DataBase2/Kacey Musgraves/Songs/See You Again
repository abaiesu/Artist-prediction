I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like I must have known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said "Oh she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then
I, I can't wait to see you again

I've got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again

The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said "Oh she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then
I, I can't wait to see you again

I've got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim

The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said "Oh she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then
I, I can't wait to see you again
