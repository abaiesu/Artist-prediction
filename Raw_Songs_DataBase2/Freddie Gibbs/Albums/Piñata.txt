Album: Piñata

// Supplier //

"They're supplying to the dope
to the black and the Mexican communities..."

"Everything that I was taught that..
only the strong survives; you know meaning well"

[some woman interrupts]

"Whether or not you would had to
y'know scrape, bait, or whatever you had to do man
The thing was to get it
It really didn't matter what the means was
or how you had to go and get it
If it means that you had to, step on TEN people
to get a dollar, then you'd step on ten people
and you know this is what I heard constantly
Only the strong survive"

// Scarface //

[scratched in:]
"Blood gushin, I think I hear sirens"

Uhh
Yo kill the muh'fucker to the right man
Do the shit (One Blood) nigga
Don't muh'fuckin freeze
Uhh...

Chiefin on that think-I-hear-my-heartbeat
Smokin every, rollin stogies on a dark street
Let's jack this nigga cause he got some shit we can't afford
'Nother day in Gary, 'nother couple niggaz in the morgue
He got the beatin, his weed crumbs on plush seats
Niggaz wanna hate, they get yellow taped and white sheets
And he steady talkin, my chopper he gonna let it rip
All the bullets that got my name are all still in clip
Life's a bitch, I was a virgin, hope she let me fuck
Pray I missed before a nigga bust his last nut
Homey eighty-fo' got the same ribs that mine had
Freddie jumped up in it like fetch me in with the dime bags
I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Pullin stick ups to the nigga from a no name
Diamond bezel, went from pebbles to a whole thang
Now them punk detectives in my section know my whole name
Gibbs, nigga, uhh, fo'sho
What'chu know about that motherfuckin point blank murder nigga?
Motherfuckin armed robbery nigga
What'chu know about that motherfuckin strong arm shit?
8100, knahmsayin bitch?
Been there and done it y'knahmsayin?
Motherfuckin ski mask
What'chu know about that motherfuckin duct tape to a nigga face nigga?
Knahmsayin that real shit, motherfuckin nose on the muh'fuckin ground nigga
Whole families nigga, ease everything like that
Grandma, uncle, cousin, everybody on the God damn flo' bitch
Uhh, yeah...

// Deeper //

Slammin - half a thang of her-on in the bathroom (damn!)
Keep an AK and the backup in the backroom
Cook a meal clean and she suck me like a vacuum
Took a vacation to the county, I'll be back soon
Sent a couple zero's, money on my J-pay
Payin off the COs', smoking on the gateway
Word around the block when I was locked she gave my thang away
'Bout to have a baby with a nigga, that's what they say 
(They say) Damn... Well, please say it ain't so
Took off the glove, say it's love when it ain't though
Her classmate was comin over, that was strange though
Apparently the homework ain't all he came for
Maybe you stank ho, maybe that's a bit mean
Maybe you grew up and I'm still livin like I'm sixteen
Like a child runnin wild in the city streets
Man I put that bitch up on her feet, she cut a nigga deep

Damn... bitch!
(That's why I treat these hoes the way I treat 'em now)
That's deeper than a muh'fucker baby, know what I'm sayin?

Slammin - Smack it up and flip it, then I rub it down
Zip it up, and then I ship it to another town
Smokin hella weed while me and Willie bust a couple pounds
She used to like that type of shit, now we don't fuck around
Girl you used to say them other niggaz wasn't hood enough
Got your lil' degree, now niggaz from the hood ain't good enough
Bitch you wasn't trippin when that old school was pullin up
You was short on ends at your college, who would put 'em up?
(Put em up) Uh... Well bitch, I'm out here puttin on
I hope you feel the pain I'm feelin when you hear this song
Don't want a nigga that's gon' slang shit up in your home
But you ran off and got engaged, man that shit was wrong
All to a nigga that don't got nothin that I ain't got
Only difference is he tryna be a fuckin astronaut
Saw this pussy nigga when I walked up in the barber shop
Green as a leaf, lookin sweet, that cut a nigga deep

Damn...
So these the type of niggaz you fuckin with now, baby?
Nuhmsayin? Square ass muh'fucker 
(You used to love a thug nigga) Yeah, yeah

Uhh~! I love her and she love him, so I never touch him
She's got his baby in the oven, so it's motherfuck him
Ain't trippin cause you got a nigga, I just think you rushin
But leavin him to be with me ain't part of our discussion (nah..)
Plus I'm on the road now, different color hoes now
Layed back on the dope, I'm gettin dollars off my shows now
Bitches wanna tie me down, but I ain't in that mode now
Five years later, why you callin up my phone now? 
(Phone now) Uh... Well bitch, how you get the number?
Like every other month I'm switchin up that motherfucker
Back on the bus I used to finger-fuck her singin Usher
Down on my luck and then she upped and left me for a sucka
I reminisce on all the crazy shit we did
You and me forever, shit we say when we was kids
She said, "I'm havin problems and I pray that he forgive
when he find out the baby ain't his", that cut a nigga deep

Damn... What the fuck?
So, what you tryna say baby?
The baby ain't his? Whose is it?
Uh, yea..

// High //

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G.]
How's everybody doin tonight?
(Alright) Ha ha right? I like that...
[squeaking speaker feedback]
"Just play our tape, cause.. live for the whole block.. right now"
"Cause we get all that.."

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Indo, kushed out
Trillest nigga livin ever pushed out
Never finished college like my brother or my sister
I was in the crib layin on a kush cloud
Getting zoned out, eyes red
Momma and my daddy said my mind dead
They said I never had a clue, said the bills past due
Fuck you nigga, you gotta remind Fred
Cause I'm car-free, sucker-free
Remember when these niggaz wouldn't fuck with me
But now I'm on the screen and these magazines
they be tryin to stop a nigga like "Smoke somethin G"
and "Can we get a couple grams?" Nigga hell naw
Unless you come in with the cash, tryin to tell y'all
I got you motherfuckers gassed on the smell, dog
So go 'head and take a hit of what I'm 'bout to sell y'all
I gets high

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I get high, I get high, I get high
(I-I-I gets high)

[Freddie Gibbs:]
I get so, blowed I can't stand up
I'm in the bed with Elise and Amanda
Cause in my shows I make them hoes put they hands up
So they came into my room, they gettin rammed up
We trying to slam or what? Because I'm tryin to smoke
So when I finish with these Swishers I'll be down your throat
And two of y'all, one of me, three of us, should I hit my niggaz up?
Hell naw, I'ma pound them both
Cause this a one man job, ain't no need for the crew
Two snow bunnies on the East what it do?
White snow in the crib if you need that too
Got some bitches and some bud, nigga bring that through
I gets high

[Chorus]

[Danny Brown:]
Early in the mornin gettin high with crusty eyes
Rubbin on her mother, well you know it's do or die
Hoppin off the porch, had to get on my grind
All because the trouble just copped to my nine
Back in the Caddy smokin Swishers with my nigga
Make a store run, 'bout to cop out some liquor
Burning down basements, face it
Run a bus stop, I'm tradin hoes and you know we ain't payin
Midwest, lovin all the dopin in the kitchen
Heatin up the house where your shit could come up missin
Dope fiend trippin cause he just copped a nick
But he say he can't find it, but it's right in his pocket
All day long, gotta get my guap'
Just put a deuce and I'm smokin on the tropic
On another subject, lights is the topic
Cause he talkin money so nigga just stop it
All day long gettin high on the low
Bitch snow bunny be sniffin that snow
Twerkin that summer, I really don't know
Cause me, Freddie Gibbs, Madlib stay blowed

[Chorus gets Screwed & Slowed]

[Outro:]
Hey, are you okay?
You slobbin, you okay?
Is he okay? Are you okay?
[LOUD WAILING]
He shouldn't have smoked that dipper for real
You aight? Oh my Gawwd [moaning]
God bless, man

// Harold's //

Uhh, nigga
Niggaz was wearin budget
Talkin 'bout like, real school third grade
Wearin budget, shit, ya bitch! Yeah

I keep a chip off in my cell phone, pocket full of stones
Smokin on the strong, Freddy Kane, Freddy Corleone
Marshalltown niggaz had a nigga runnin home
I call collect, get me a 38, now bitch it's on
9 millimeter, Baretta to 40 cal
By 23 fresh up out the box, bitch I hold it down
I hit the stroll with a chili bowl and a crooked smile
Fast forward ten years came back with Roley's with golden crowns
Skinny nigga; six wing mild sauce
With all the fries you can give me I tear them bitches off
Ski mask on yo' baby daddy? Well that's that nigga loss
Pointin my trey five seven, I got my point across
A skinny nigga; six wing mild sauce
With all the fries you can give me I tear them bitches off
This burnin hole in my pocket got me out here 50 soft
223 on my enemy I tear them bitches off
Bitch

[Chorus:]
Skinny nigga; six wing mild sauce
With all the fries you can give me I tear them bitches off
A plate of chicken with the bread stuck to the bottom
But fuck my enemies, what'chu lookin for bitch I got 'em
Bitch, bitch I got 'em; bitch, bitch I got 'em
Fuck my enemies what'chu lookin for bitch I got 'em
Bitch, bitch I got 'em; bitch, bitch I got 'em
Fuck my enemies what'chu lookin for bitch I got 'em

Uhh - KFC, Harold's, Sharks and Popeyes
Adidas suit with a plate of chicken, got mob ties
A fresh Delt', weed crumbs on my plush seats
I got my license now I'm backseat fuckin every week
A thick bitch live in Miller, go to work
3:30 school was out then I was fresh under her skirt
Them project niggaz hit that bitch that pussy went berserk
Don't hit without that Trojan fuck around you might get burnt
She was raised in the church, turnt out in the ghetto
Lock it, pussy pop it, I swear this bitch deserve a medal
Seen school girls turn into strippers in stilletos
Pimpin' 'til I die, if you wanna stop then get a shovel bitch
Extra sauce with the bread stuck to the bottom
Freddie Forgiato, all my bitches spoiled rotten
Cop that llama, got the hollows poppin out the barrel
Got a stain for them hubbas meet me at the Harold's

Bitch! I remember when they had some 15 right on 15 nigga
Fo'sho I used to hit that motherfucker all the time nigga
Straight dope stains and chicken wangs, y'knahmsayin?
Uhh, yeah, yeah~!

[Chorus]

// Bomb //

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah..
Slammin! Drugs got me wakin up in cold sweats
Sometimes I'm slightly off my rocker, but I'm on deck
Got two and a baby off my bitch's student loan check
She hit my line to get that girl I call it phone sex
Robbin like my problems ain't gon' catch up to me later
Bitch I'm mobbing like O.G. Bobby Johnson, split your potato
Every table, cookin shavin and touchin base with them basers
Bet they try to make a play for the yay' as soon as they taste it
The amazin black American Gangster, sinister corner hugger
Seein this nigga shine been annoyin me like a muh'fucker
This busta owe me, now he act like he don't know me
Forty fo' my closest homie, kill cock-a-aroaches like Tony
Got Montana money
You bought 100, dipped in fluid, yo I had to smoke it
Pupils dilated like silver dollars, now we kno-ckin
Call it devilish how I do bitch
Fuck these niggaz talkin, I leave they thoughts on my shoestrings
What? Uhh, yeah
Ah f'sho, yeah

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Rollin; pockets all swollen
Set the record straight that FNH is what I'm holdin
A busta that we know got 15 'bows, bust it open
We came bandana'd up, divide it up, now what's the quotient?
A split with 4 niggaz, since I'm a go getter
I think these suckers pussy, I'ma merk the whole litter
Told my girl to leave as soon as I hung up the phone with her
Man I heard you rob the robbers, look Freddie a cold nigga
Got an ice maker for a heart, made nigga from the start
Life is like a movie, all I did was play my fuckin part
(Cheffin') up the crack, the heroin, and weed a la carte
I call it Fast Freddie's, I should own a fuckin restaurant
Cause back when I was 12 threw some bells on a scale and I got a pager
We broke 'em down and started selling nickels to the neighbors
Eventually the penitentiary gon' see me later
Kiss my momma told her if I die then it was part of nature
What?

[Raekwon:]
(28 Days Later) we all gettin fresh
Got the heart to die for somethin, flesh to flesh
The Lambo got her outside, it's a stretch
My bitch half Mexican/Afghan I'm blessed
From living tough times with rough lemons, a gorgeous watch
My team on a dreadful level yo
Yeah, we still gettin money right?
Long as the sun come out, I'll hold these twenties tight
Getting fresh, just coolin, my bitch on my dick
But boom yo, you live with your moms, just get a grip
Clip in my pocket, a rocket
I think of the (Dips), I need Juelz and Jims with rough licks
Trips to Africa, shorty tear Saks up
I'm out in Bombay, rebels here actin up
We real, all G, 7500 of us
Up in the Sprinter bus, fussin "We need more heat"

// Shitsville //

Yeah (where's my money bitch?)
Uhh

Niggaz ain't gon' shit then get the fuck up off the toilet stool
Bent behind my tint as I commence to take these boys to school
Don't drive no yellow bus but I got mayonnaise and mustard
Bold tires, gold wires on my Chevrolet bucket
And now my transmission leakin and my rear-suspension squeakin
Drop a rock off to my geeker, fix my shit man I'm out here creepin
Twist that shit but I'm out here tweakin for that 20 twin twin
Kick that shit in '95 or watching (Friday) with my friends
Fucked your bitch in ninety-six hit that pussy for 6 minutes
Said the dick was everything she envisioned on each visit
Poppa kept his condoms in his bottom drawer they for his bottom ho
I stole that shit when I was out, I wonder if my momma know
I wonder if she found the dimes and nickels in my Nike box
I wonder if she know her older brother like to light them rocks
I wonder if she able to get by if I get killed
Tell her I was just knee deep in the shit, welcome to Shitsville nigga

[Chorus:]
You wake up every day and pray before you sleep, right?
You motherfuckers just like me
You shed tears when you hurtin if I cut you then you bleed, right?
You motherfuckers just like me
But bitch you actin like your shit don't stank - the shit's real
Bitch you actin like your shit don't stank - the shit's real
I said you actin like the shit don't stank - the shit's real
Bitch you actin like the shit don't stank - welcome to Shitsville

Yo, uhh; niggaz ain't gon' shit then get the fuck up off the pizzot
Got bowls of live in my living room like I was Lennox
Trapped a nigga and his wife up for his wallet and his wristwatch
And they say I might do life in jail for kidnap, bitch I did not
give a single solitary fuck; I stand on all ten toes
one dick and two nuts - don't do yayo or shoot up
But I went back and forth with some work done went threw a few plugs
This white devil society dare a nigga to do drugs
and dare yo ass to deal 'em, distribute and conceal 'em
My niggaz don't got no boats or no ports, how you think we get 'em?
Crack was black America's cup of coffee in the beginnin
When they crept up on you wiggers, you crackers couldn't fight the feelin
Motherfuck euthanasia I'll lace your food up with razors
Make you gargle with salt water, excuse yourself from my table
I fathered these fuck niggaz with fables; pussy I been real
Good on any street, up Shit's Creek, it's Shitsville nigga

[Chorus]

Cheat on your girl, your wife sneak out and fuck hoes
You motherfuckers just like me
Drink all the liquor, blow weed, probably play wit'cha nose
You motherfuckers just like me
I said you motherfuckers just like me
I said you motherfuckers just like me
I know you motherfuckers just like me
You ain't no better, ho you just like me
Uhh...

// Thuggin' //

"Somebody warn the west, nigga ain't runnin"
"Somebody wa- nigga ain't runnin no more"
"The Legend of Nigga in color, rated PG"
"Parental Guidance suggested"

[Intro:]
Uh...yeah..Fa sho'
Niggaz be comin at me like,
"Yo, yo Fred man... You a real nigga, dawg"
Real nigga (Real nigga)
I be like (from front to the back), "Respect man"
(Respect) These fake niggaz done lowered the bar, ynahmsayin?

Niggaz be like "Fred, you ain't never lied"
Fuck the rap shit my gangsta is solidified
Still do my bih'ness on the side
Bitch if you police-ses, then pay me no nevermind
I was thuggin -- Black and red laces in my number 3s'
Take a pull up off the wood and let that motherfucker breathe
Sit outside a busta crib and let that motherfucker leave
Walk his ass back in and put him on his motherfuckin knees
Thuggin -- Never takin no for an answer
Might just take a loss but bitch I'd rather take my chances
This liquor got me lurkin where you livin in the night time
59Fifty to the left but I'm in my right mind
Thuggin -- Pants gon' be saggin 'til I'm forty
Still lyrically sharper than these (ShawtBusShawtys)
Them phonies ain't gon' throw me in this minstrel show
These labels see how far up in they mouth my dick could go
So gon' and, choke on this meat and throw my song on repeat
Might move away one day but I'm always gon' belong to the streets
I'm straight thuggin

[Chorus:]
And it feels so good, uh and it feels so right 
Yeah, and it feels so good uh, and it feels so right
Cause motherfucker I'm thuggin

Sellin you the science of the street rap
Every motherfuckin show I do is off the meat rack
I done been in jail and did my best not to repeat that
I'm tryna feed my family, give a fuck about yo' feedback
Critically acclaimed, but that shit don't mean a thang
When you rockin mics and still in microwaves cookin 'caine
Never trickin on a dame, I'm too cold for you broke hoes
Don't let the knob hitcha booty when the door close, BITCH!
She let me hit it cause I'm thuggin
Squares need not apply, I'm so fly I might fuck her cousin
Swiftly 'bout to stick a sweet dick in ya sweetheart
Then get some groceries off, might geek a EBT card
Why the Feds worried 'bout me clockin on this corner
when there's politicians out here gettin popped in Arizona
Bitch, I'm thuggin'

[Chorus]

Yo, yo, we're not against rap, but we're against those thugs
Can't be legit when every nigga in ya clique sold drugs
Predicate felons in my faculty, real killers can vouch for me
Teach a kid at the crib or your children might cop an ounce from me
And smoke out in the Chevy with us, cause in the past
My low-class black ass would serve my own fuckin family members
I hate to say it, ain't no need to be discreet
If she don't cop from me, she get it from a nigga up the street
Cause he thuggin -- And yo she'd probably suck his dick for it
She turned out so it ain't shit to turn a trick for it (Nasty bitch)
My uncle last bitch, put him on the glass dick
Tried to rob a man to feed his habit, he got blasted
I live on borrowed time, my expiration date I past it
So lock me up forever, but this shit is everlasting
I'm thuggin

[Chorus]

Bitch!

// Real //

Remember everybody ain't loyal
You soft as gelatin, sick of telling them, nigga show 'em
It's coke in the pot, nigga drop it and let it boil
Goofy niggas make me nervous, ain't serve 'em if I ain't know 'em
Eastside, sleeping in my dope house clothes
Run down pair of Jordans and some dirty Girbauds
Sucker coming with a short, he get extorted, exposed
Nigga stand on my own two balls, my dick and ten toes
Straight to the tippy top
Hear this nigga spitting it, whether I got a hit or not
I hit it with the whip, they notice it when they hit the rock
I'm just a cocaina chemist
Cooking, chopping and cutting, you'll die if I push a button
Niggas heard of me, now all of a sudden they back to thugging
If I never sell a record might catch me hot water juggin'
The D.A. want me gone, say I'm detriment to the public
Took his daughter, put this dick in her butt
And said "how you love it, bitch?"
Remember everybody ain't loyal
Cause all the real niggas in jail or deep in the soil
Dancing with the devil or eating fish with the Lord
Gotta spit it how I live it, I beat the street and report, nigga
All the real niggas either in jail or deep in the soil, nigga

The world ain't big enough for both of us
Batter up, now you pussy niggas getting fucked
Straight raw with infection, passing no prophylactic
Eastside, anybody killa, my niggas active
Smoking and breaking a 7 up in a 6-5-0
Babyface Gangsta I been slanging, banging since 9-4
I thought the world was at my feet when I linked up with Snow
But I refuse to be his flunkie, so we don't kick it no mo'
Straight to the facts, nigga
I looked up to you, put that on my momma
Signed a deal with you and never asked you for a dollar
Cause I was down with CTE, plus I was getting cheese
I played my fuck ass contract, what the lick read?
Thought I'd say this shit cause you ain't man enough to come discuss it
You wanna be Jay-Z? Nigga you just a fucking puppet
Gary boys ain't 'bout talkin', so bitch I had to show ya
Don't make me expose you to those that don't know ya
Man you said you the realest nigga in this motherfucker, check it
But Ross had you scared to drop a diss record
No nuts, got the whole team looking weak
Guess that's why they ran up on you at the BET
L.A. red carpet, yeah, I was geeked
You couldn't take security, so we ain't take a seat
I played the fool before, but yo a ho I'll never be
They searched that tour bus in Milwaukee, had that .44 with me
ESGN and to the end, I feed the killers
Pray the Lord'll take my breath before I be like this monkey nigga
Just a whole lot of rapping, but no motherfucking action
Seen Gucci by himself while we was 30 deep at Magic
And you didn't bust a grape, was shook from the gate
It make it seem to me the gangsta shit you kick be fake
Cause all my enemies, I put them suckers in their place
So take them shades up of your eyes, and look me in my fucking face
Cause I'm a motherfucking rare breed
The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again
Don't reproduce nothin' but evil seeds
I'm rapping and trapping and still ducking these F-E-D's
But BMF was sticking you for your fucking cheese
And yeah I know you sold the blow and whipped the hard
But underneath the fucking money you's a fucking mark
Take heed to my statements, because they might throw you
Don't make me expose you to those who don't know you
Bitch
Snowman Killa

// Uno //

Yeah, fa'sho'
Uhh.. fuck the competition nigga
Yeah..

Uhh - fuck niggaz, spark the weed up
Shit been watered down, the rap game they need us
Real niggaz to intervene, they interject
Got a bitch naked, got some neck in the 'Vette and I'm fin' to jet
Fin' to get fucked up in this bitch that's on fiend
Poppin yoppers, fuck the coppers, sell narcotics, nigga we bring that on in
Bitch, I'm a problem, got your columns full of losses no wins
Gary gangsta, fuck with Chicago niggaz out that Low End
Much love to my nigga Mikey, threw muzzles off in they mouth
Nigga hittin licks where we reside for unspecified amounts
Stuff the mattress full of merch, .40 calibers in the couch
Guess I'm on the hot seat, rob me won't make it out
I could make her sharpen my attitude, might just make her pout
Find me charming 'til she really found out what I was about
My recreation, occupation, invadin a nigga house
Smokin and ridin, I ain't high when I'm drivin, I highly doubt
And I - don't believe these rap niggaz
You can front for your fans but I know it's an act nigga
Judge a man by his character and not by his wealth
A real G, I never kissed niggaz or shot myself
Gangsta Gibbs

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm number one, number one with a bullet
Bring your guns, fifty shots when I pull it
Make 'em run, make you motherfuckers bleed
Only fuck with real G's, public enemies

Probably be murdered for some shit that I said
I'd be a legend out this motherfucker breathin or dead
But y'all don't hear me, these uppity bitches they all fear me
Fuck a diamond on your finger, I guess it's the dog in me
Ain't no hog in me, I'm swine-free, suckers the Iron Sheik
Nine G's for the nine piece, how you define me?
A student of the thug nigga, drug dealer college
Majored in robbin and graduated with honors
Seein plenty dudes in Dolce Gabbana's and marijuana fog
Niggaz trying to vulture the culture, motherfuck all of y'all
Dick blowers, rapper reality shows
Y'all just attention whores
Don't give a fuck if I set a record or win awards
I'm just blessed to be out here livin life
Giving these niggaz hell, so records with everything I write
Shit got me wishin DMX had never hit the pipe
Pun ain't never died and Big L was still here to bless the mic

[Chorus]

// Robes //

[Hook:]
They often see what we can't see
Wearing a smile
You never ever find a frown…

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
You ain't shit if you ain't ever struggled
You gotta put in hard work before you flex your muscles
I see where niggas fall off tryna perfect the puzzle
You ain't gotta like my work shit, respect my hustle
I was a solid hearted mind before I had to grind, my swagger fine
I never had to pack my lines with plastic rhymes
Diamond in the rough, give it time, you'll find your light and shine
This little light of mine, these are our highest times
My third eye divine, I see my skies aligned
I feel like one with the moon but that's some other shit
I stopped caring how people see me and I'm loving it
But no desire for your input, I does my shit
Say what you want but know my ignorance is fucking bliss

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Pardon the scents
Checking press releases off the beeper like a pimp
Smanging lever off the strength, threw his demons off the cliff
The scenic route below, tires screaming in the mist
And like the key open the door I twist
The weed I bought because I don't know how to cope with shit
Be easy I could three hit 'em right where his shoulder sit
Maneuver throught the swamp like a four-wheeler
Hitting it quickly after a coarse greeting
Leave like the father I never had or a low Caesar
The son he had but ain't never wanted like cold pizza
Skull and bones out the same closet I grow reefer
The team eatin', cold-hearted, spit feces

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Fuck every rapper and his entourage
Fuck up the stage and blow dodi smoke on his bodyguards
Nothin' but Cutlasses, Cadillac coupes in my garage
Make foreign bread, get some morning head on the Autobahn
Faces, smiling faces, they keep me motivated
And I got plenty fans but I ain't shit without my haters
Know this pussy A&R that threw some bullshit cross the table
Then next year I still be rappin' and he be fired from his label
Damn, bitch, I'm in the mob, I always got a job
Breakin' down the Keisha gettin' Brandon Marshall for the quad
Brett Favre for the zone, five bands for the whole
Wrist piece solid gold, neck piece arctic froze
Give you the smarts and the parts and also regarding hoes
He chase a bitch but I was chose
I only think of you, on two occasions
That's when I'm drunk and when I'm blazin' up
My Filipino bitch she fly me to LA to fuck
I weigh my options, I'd rather be cookin' cuttin' and weighin' up
Bitch, it's Gibbs!

[Hook]

// Broken //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, Allah the merciful, the beneficent
Curse over blessing, pray it be heaven sent
Forgive me, my dirty deeds was desperate
Fuck the government, I got my own deficit
Death to me the only thing that's definite
Money rule the world, but when you dead that shit's irrelevant
Fingers numb from coka selling, no vote, but out for presidents
Granny found my dope, I told her I would stop for selling it
Nigga please -- she knew I was lying before I even spoke it
Empty promises left them all broken
She said "Jamel, I can tell your perspective out of focus
You too obsessed with the liquor, bitches and weed smoking"
A young nigga that's been thugging since the old days
Promise I've done seen everything but old age
Pray my demons never catch up from my old ways
Keep the heat cause I was going through a cold phase

[Hook:]
Keep the heat cause I was going through a cold phase
Promise I've done seen everything but old age

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Surviving off cold cuts and cold Spam
Can't see eye to eye with my old man
Hiding my insecurities with this gang flag
We both despise the police, but he wore the same badge
And as I child I admired that, now I wonder how
He was a pig, but you was barely making 20 thou
I guess that's why you put me on that lick for 20 pounds
A life of crime is all we ever shared from then to now
And I'm a crook and you crooked, that's all we got in common
He chucked the deuce to my mama, so much for family bonding
But how could something so destined to be just get demolished?
Running through groupies and boppers, I guess I got it honest
And honestly I know I'm out here fucking up
Seven grams of rock, I stuff 'em in my nuts
And seven bucks an hour wasn't good enough
Cause seven days a week I'm living in a rush

[Hook:]
Seven days a week I'm living in a rush
Seven grams of rock, I stuff 'em in my nuts

[Verse 3: Scarface]
And the money was the root to what the evil is
It's mandatory for me to live
I hustle harder than the next dude
Remember, everybody is out to get you
Niggas don't respect to live and let live
So I pack a .40 caliber cause that's how shit is
Out here, no fear, fuck feelings
Trigger man rule, that's the art of drug dealing
I'm trying to stack my money to the ceiling
No new friends, don't wanna talk about old business
Sex on the beach, sipping Guinness
With a bitch so thick she can't take no dick
Imagine working grave-yard shifts
Bossman steady talking that shit
A million a day is for minimum wage
Work a nigga like a slave 'til he put him in his grave
Frail moments, same page

[Hook:]
Seven days a week I'm living in a rush
Seven grams of rock, I stuff 'em in my nuts

// Lakers //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Nigga, fuck it, 77 Cutlass
I move my ass to Cali with my Indiana bucket
I need to slap a wet one on the frame, a little rusty
They call my shit a scraper in the bay bitches love it
And I'm choking on some Cali good
Been want to cruise on Crenshaw
Since a little nigga watching Boyz n in the Hood
Since Ricky got killed, copping that corn meal
Before the palm trees, pussy and the recording years
I was overdue for a visit
A valley bitch with family in the Chi gave me the digits
The 818, the sex was great, perfect the art of fornication
Put a bitch out the car for a bar, your Cali conversation
All my hoes from way back want me to be chilling where they at
G.I. until I die, but bitch L.A. is where I lay at
My children gon' be raised at where they gon' place my grave at
Since Magic bought the team, he brought new meaning to that L.A. hat
Shout out to the blocks
Inglewood, Compton, South Central to Watts

[Hook: Polyester The Saint]
My home, my home L.A. I ride for you
(That's where I stay at, nigga)
(That's where I lay at, nigga)
When I am gone just know that I owe you

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I'm on my way to LAX from JFK, it's a great day
I mean I love New York, but of course
I live out there so don't go there, you heard it before
Ironic my uncle had the king of music on Crenshaw
Cause now I'm the king to music to all y'all
California love, California dreaming
I've seen lost angels, I even found demons
Where you learn to survive and keep your head high
Hit the weed clinic 'fore sativa get your head high
We ain't in Kansas City, but you'll find a TEC-9
And if that tech jammed you better have a toast too
Fuck that, this what we gon' toast to
Everybody that ain't die before 21 like we was s'posed to
For the mail I'm going postal
I heard the baddest females on pacific coastal
If it means anything, I'm so L.A. my dad died on King, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, went from a condo 'til sleeping on my nigga couch
Popping sedatives, negatives in my bank account
Too much pride to let this pussy industry play me out
Repairing that broken dream, that's what L.A. about
Shout to Cali Bud, my Westcoast plug
Brother from another mother, he showed that Westcoast love
Nigga, me and Killa Caz was pulling them stick-ups, cuz
Bending blocks with my nigga Box smoking the whip up Blood
Gots to keep it true when I maneuver
I got all kind of homies, Harlems, Avalons and Hoovers
My little homie from Families, he keep a team of shooters
My 60 niggas stay Rolling, my Eight Trey niggas moving
Been 20 years since the riots
L.A. nigga keep it thorough, fuck keeping quiet
Bitch it's on in this war zone where we reside
As I begin let my sins wash away with the tides
Who the fuck I'm kidding? I done tried everything but dying
Flirting with other places, but this Cali bitch stay on my mind

[Hook]

[Intro:]
Time to shut it on down baby, you know what I'm sayin'?
You sure you want to do this shit tonight because it might hurt baby, you know what I'm sayin'?
Might hurt you when I, get up in the morning and leave
Take that walk you know what I mean?

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Slammin'
When I hit you up I'm talking about bangin' something
Chill off in your crib and have a thing, probably make it stank or something
Girl you like my bottom bitch, post my bail, pay for my lawyer
Play your position when them other hoes get out of order
When you wanna give me that pussy? You purchase a plane ticket
Run around town, when I bust her down they want shit like them lames did it
Got her dick whipped, my dick smeared with lipstick
Basically if this bitch lay with me she payin' me, I'm on some pimp shit
For real! It's 2 A.M. club was bout' to close up
Thumbing through my contacts bout' to call one of my hoes up
Then I met you, kicked game and followed you to the breakfast spot
Fucked you like I married you that night up in the Marriot
Scream like you got your cherry popped
Fucking, switching up positions
Thought this shit would never stop
Motherfuck an intermission
Damn!

(Here we are again)

[Hook x2: BJ the Chicago Kid]
It ain't got to be the walk of shame, baby
But that's only if you know the game, baby
Later I can't be the one to blame, baby
But for now take the walk of shame, baby

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Straight Slammin'
Sleepin' with pistols under my pillow
We wake and bake, she up naked twistin' up cigarillos
I beat that Thursday night and Friday morning, off to work she go
Time to take that walk, just take this dick, don't take it personal
Your friends probably gonna call you a ho, but you should have known
Them bitches want a grip from the same dick you be sitting on
And your girl Monique, she be hitting me when her nigga gone
Trying to buy some weed she proceed with nothing but Vicky's on
Nothing but ass and titties, but I let that ass convince me
Took it in that, hit that, wish I could say it was accidentally
Like I stepped on a banana peel and fell in that pussy
Y'all niggas be spending all kind of scrill to get in that pussy
And she cop a seven every Friday
Chuck the deuces at her baby daddy as I pulled up out the drive-way
For real

(Here we are again)

[Hook x2]

// Watts //

"I'm a vampire!" (Woooooo)
"The Sou..."

[Big Time Watts:]
Hey hello well I'ma tell you somethin about yo' motherfuckin self mayne
Fuck you nigga! You you left the family out

// Piñata //

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Live like 9-5, I rhyme and come alive
My grind divides fine through my divine eyes
It's prime time, you wish you could buy time, but it's my time
Thoughts against I, blasphemy, it's like a vice crime
I roll 'em thick and I ignite mines
I don't even get high, I just get equally back in my right mind
I'm getting lethal with these nice lines
Creeping through your speakers
Catch you sleeping like a thief of in the nighttime
Young Doms, none of you niggas correspond, bitch
Kick the fuck out of the track on some Jean-Claude shit
Get the fuck out of the streets, nigga, I bomb shit
Shit ain't all good no more, y'all on your con shit
The fuck is your conscience? Testing me is nonsense
The whole city is mine, I'm the best up in my conference
Ain't feeling me, fine, ain't gotta listen to my shit
You can hear about me from the critics all on my dick

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Bitch, I've been thugging since the motherfucking Ten Speed
Redbone on my handlebars, I like my bitches mixed breeds
Feel the Philly tighten with a 20 sack of stress weed
Educated, at the stove I'm working recipes
Reputation say I'm robbing just for recreation
Revive my enemy with gun-to-mouth resuscitation
Can't wait to this pussy nigga pay me, I'm impatient
Let's go kick in their door and strip them naked, leave 'em stinking
No witness, no weapon, my nigga, the case is over
The reaper snatched 'em, closed casket, his family needs a closure
And Moses had ten commandments, Huey had ten points
Won't see my homie for ten, dropped him off at the joint
Staring at my future in my rear-view
Family cried some tears, I got some years, it ain't no issue
Mama with the tissue
Saw her breaking down, she just might cry a river
Murder one, she can't believe she raised that type of nigga

[Verse 3: G-Wiz]
I tried to do right, but it only got your boy fucked in the game
So I changed my mind, now I'm back on this grind
Trying to get this change
Niggas hate to see me getting it
Travelling packs with a red dot
Boy, it ain't your knot, trying to get what you got
When the rain and the pain gon' stop
Standing on the porch early, no shoes, selling blow in my socks
And I was watching for the ghetto bird
Ain't got no money for college
So all I know is how to sack and how to serve
I be damned if I miss another lick for the chips
Got me stacking, almost splurging on weed, syrup and whips
Niggas around my way be loving it
I'm Cadillac'ing, blowing good alligators with the belts to match
I got an ounce with an ounce to match, bust it down, get back
Hopefully maybe get the clique out the trap
I need dough like a bread baker (Amen)
24/7, got ready on the turf, player
All day

[Verse 4: Casey Veggies]
Make 'em hop in the new coupe
Niggas been winning, that ain't nothing new
Forgive me for the sinning that they be doing in this business
Not using their words to express truth
Out in the streets with a screw loose
On the Westside I got the juice
Just tell me what you trying to do
She loving the crew and ain't fucking with you
I go where the hood niggas get into it
I go where the bad girls go shop
Every window tinted but the rooftop
That money I'll just spend it to get you shot
Can they be hating, they got no reason
Right where they got me, the place I Delete 'em
We kicking on weaklings just for all of their secrets
I can't believe the shit that I'm seeing
I'm hearing the words, doing my reading, it's really absurd
Not enough leaders, the shit that they feed you, it's just what you eating
They call me young Veggies, I make it go green
I smash in all your teeth, the fuck is you saying?
You got the candy's, the niggas is spraying
To get away and take over the land, yeah

[Verse 5: Sulaiman]
My mind on capital, I'm not just rapping, dude
I'm out to speak actual factual, watch how a master moves
You ball a fist what that gon do
I'm from a city clapping fools
You off the tit and [?] lacking while watching me fashion stools
Shitting styles, you never had a hot line that I didn't dial
Little princes always trying to fit a bigger crown
But don't forget I sit amidst some seasoned gents
Them bitches knowing he a pimp ain't even need to read the blimp
It was a good day, good day to O'Shea
A death certificate for anyone who lay in my way
You best revisit all the tombstones that lay in my wake
Me being knowledge, be honest
You seen the prophet get sacrificed by the Ops
It get ratchet when ratchets out and they firing
Residue on pinata's, wonder what's up inside of 'em
It's sure ain't no Vicodin cause it up and excited 'em
But they ain't get high enough, if you ain't succeed, nigga
Buy again then try again

[Verse 6: Meechy Darko]
It's the irrational type of nigga, the John Madden tackle you
Steal your car keys and crash your coupe in the botanical
Wrap you with shackles, tangle you, pull from ever angle, dismantle you
Watch your blood mixed with mud and stain the gravel too
Grab and shoot, rib cage open like a parachute
Close range, Swiss blade, poke 'em if it's personal
Blood stains, gold fangs, mask on, no traits
Murder one, closed case, stolen whip, no plates
Half a body in the trunk, go to prison, no way
Speed off the Brooklyn bridge before I catch a cold case
Realize I'm the voice for those who do not have a voice
So I voice my fucking voice, I don't have a fucking choice
Cold blooded, leave some niggas, well I hope you got insurance
Shotgun and shorty lift 'em like the potent in my joint
Barrels smoking like Red Auerbach
Still can't believe I'm getting fed on rap
I don't know what's louder, the pack or the gat

[Verse 7: Mac Miller]
My endorphins are morphin', absorbin' energy
Original copy, A Tale of Two Cities gets read to me
Reading Emerson novels eating some Belgian waffles
Some powder go up my nostrils, my dick going down her tonsils
What's up? Play with an abacus, I've been stressing like Catholics
That's the shit, a bit of that happiness in my cup
This generation corrupt, these people brainwashed with evil
My music is more cerebral, exploring just what you need to
So this your Exodus, church of the Methodist
Beating up the pussy, have her screaming like a exorcist
Absorb it through your pores, the Lord with horns, a world war
Whores are more hors d'oeuvre when it's a world tour
O'Doyle Rules

// Deep //

[Verse 1 - Freddie Gibbs:]
Alright now
Baby times is hard so I'mma change my hustle to hard white now
And couple of my customers chose with they nose
That I suppose they wanna light up with the pipe now
Sellin dope straight out the ride
Speedin past the police wouldn't advise
Got a hard pack, of that Star Trek
To make a bitch beam up to the enterprise
And you a Captain Kirk, trading ass for work
Let a bitch sniff your pack, you got burnt
Still owe me $2300 for that twerk
Finna post up at your place so don't worry
Nigga don't snitch, don't tell
Rap niggas they recite that so well
Be the same mothafucka that done ratted out his homie
He ain't even have enough no money for his own bail

[Interlude:]
Let's go
(Deep inside the ghetto)
Where I be

[Verse 2 - Freddie Gibbs:]
Fuck with a nigga
Yellin' I be fucking with them fellas
If you buying or selling you can find me
In the hood with hot goods, we got those
Nigga I just stole his rims, watch the potholes
All laws and street codes, y'all forgot those
Homie I done been on the block since a snot-nose

[Interlude:]
(Deep inside the ghetto)
Where I go

[Verse 3 - Freddie Gibbs:]
East Side, 17th Ave
Better keep a G-pass on ya G.I. to Chicago
Where the real niggas dead or locked up
Teenage pretty friends get knocked up
The young niggas out here tryna get guaped up
They ain't got no other choice they washed up
Living on the edge of addiction, STD's, and enslavement
Black blood tend to flood the street pavement
White man set the price and we pay it
All a nigga want is whips and chains
Probably cause a nigga wasn't whipped and chained
To the bottom of a boat in the middle of the ocean
Stripped of my own motherfucking name
Stripped of my whole motherfucking culture
Sold by my own to the snakes and vultures
Reality is sad, but it's true
So what can a nigga do when your own people don't support you
Fuck ass cop tryna pull me over
Trunk full of dope but I'd rather get smoked and live G

(How brave of this pig ass nigga man)

[Outro:]
I'mma take ya
To a place where a muhfucka gotta be a thug by nature
Where it's really all about that paper
Nigga try to jump, always think you're

(Deep inside the ghetto)
Where I be

Fuck with a nigga
Yellin' I be fucking with them fellas
If you buying or selling you can find me

(Deep inside the ghetto)
Where I go

G.I. to Chicago

// Terrorist //

Uhh, tales of the terrorist
Young, black, felonious, red-blooded American
Gave this bitch a taste of that lil' boy, she cherished it
Fucked her veins up, now she shoot her foot with the heroin
Twinkle toes, know single hoes that like to treat they nose
Sending muff pics, photos that got they treat exposed
I swear you oughta keep your daughter from this dirtbag
Dog nigga, scum of the Earth, for what it's worth
I been handling probation well
Smoking blunts, 36 months and I ain't seen the jail
Making music that makes a meal, fuck the recognition
But I guess my record just too reckless for the record business
Won't sell my soul to chase a check but I be checking niggas
Ether them in interviews
Industry put lames in the game like Duncan Pinderhughes
Think these niggas change they persona, then let you pick and choose
Eenie-miney-mo, so don't try me ho; bitch, I been a fool
Psychopathic whoop-ass like Michael daddy
Everything that touch my skin brand name, my brand new Caddy
Got that pussy-wet paint as I sit on the softest leather
I ain't tripping, joe, my ticket to heaven could cost whatever
I just pray the Lord don't toss me with Satan off in the cheap seats
Thought of dying broke with no legacy make my knees weak
Cause I proceed to make ends bleed, let it be grizzly
Getting green by any means out on these mean streets
Uhh, tales of the terrorist
Felonious, red-blooded American

// City //

[Karriem Riggins:]
In and out city limits, there's many men and women
Broke, when they get dough they never try to spend it
Why? 'cause you know they say we living in a recession
Never listen to the government, you know they on a mission
And I'm here to tell you, I be in my zone, listenin'
When you travel abroad, then you can see the difference in
Economies overseas and Italy
Every other whip is Maserati QP
I never learned the ins and outs while livin' in the D
Or how to pay the taxes on the income I receive
Yeah, I guess that's how the politics be
We gon' have to pave the way for y'all [?]
With Exxon stop price bubblin'
The gas price on my [?] is doublin'
Higher than the giraffe's ass, they 'bout to stick it to ya
They got a shovel, 'bout to dig in your stash

That's why we on tour and (In the city)
We live, we on tour and in your (City)
That's why we on tour and (In the city)
We live, we on tour and in your

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Yeah, moving in my Cutlass through the city limits
Roof leaking in the bucket, yeah we was penny pinchin'
Empty stomach, have you looking forward to Thanksgiving
Cold Spam, fried balogna, yeah I forgot to mention
That's what I was raised on, jumped off in the game on
I was thinking lobster like a mobster, getting my sting on
Bald caps, [?] erection, get you banged on
Living like Tony Soprano, I'll make the district change the gang laws
Gang bang, gang land, dope exchange hands
Back in '01, I hit a gangsta lick for eighty grand
Comparing me to these rappers, you must be playin'
I'm a fucking naked fire, you just a flash in the pan, God damn
And if I wasn't rapping, I'd be still flossin'
Jumped up off that phony label, now I'm straight bossin'
I'm selling keys to dope fiends, sleep walkin'
Push a cold nine, dead once you crossin' in my city

[Karrium Riggins:]
Yeah, we live, we on tour and in your (City)
That's why we on tour and (In the city)
We live, we on tour and in your (City)

Ooh, yeah

// Home //

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Uh, Lebron number nine
I guess whenever she ain't on my dick, I'm on her mind
It's quite cliche to just say that I'm on my grind
And phone conversations ain't substitution for time in another city
Reminisce on days when I ain't have a fucking penny
These groupie bitches in this game wasn't fucking with me
Couldn't get a dollar for a rap show
Got a gun, a ski mask and a half an ounce of crack, though
Slammin', in the pizza shop with Jacque
Last dollar on a slice, this contraband in my sock, wish you knew the feeling
We're both so different, but our situations so appealing
Now I can't make it without you girl, you my new religion
And every hustler needs a main thing
Baby, once I get it I'mma make your last name change
Uh, said every hustler needs a main thing
Baby, once I get it I'mma make your last name change
Gibbs, uh

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
We still socking
Glock is still popping
Paper still dropping
Lord, it ain't stopping
Girl, I'm coming home, as soon as I get this paper
Yeah, the blocks still cracking, and girl, know what I'm packing
And if you pop off, you gon' know what I'm jacking
But I'm coming home, as soon as I get this paper

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Ayo, summertime, 105°
Getting mine, the smoke line
They want the kush, the Cali kind
I smoke with' her, I choke with' it, get dosed with' her
A go-getter, helped me come up from a broke nigga
The home team
And she ain't just in my pocket, she got her own cream
Sometimes I slip at the mouth, I might say the wrong thing
And once we fight, it's back to fucking
My polos and my timbos out the window, but its nothin, what
Uh, said once we fight, it's back to fucking
I bend that ass right over on the sofa, like it's nothing
So bust it open for a player, nose to your fucking toes
I'm coming home, don't be tripping on them other hoes

// Cocaine Parties //

La-dickda-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La-da-da-da-dickda-da-a, la-a (la-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

Cocaine parties in L.A
I'm juggin' at some cocaine parties in L.A., yeah
Cocaine parties in L.A
Threw my set up at some mo' gang parties in L.A

Uh, I do it (Shake that body, party that body)
Bitch, I do it (Shake that body, party that body)
Bitch, I do it, yeah

Hey killa, you forgot your soda dawg
My mama kitchen stankin' from the last order dawg
So many cocaine transactions I don't recall
Was lit, tell the judge and the preacher presiding over y'all
Fuck the police protocol
We choppin' loads up, in the crib
No heat by the stove my toes froze up
Niggas like to fuck up their re-up money
Get rolled up
Bullet holed-up
Ran off on the plug once (once nigga)
Minor setback, major comeback
Two bitches at the Ritz Carlton I was dumb hype
I dropped the chicken then remixed it, it was dumb white
Fuck her pretty face and that pussy hoe, what your funds like
Fucked her in some $5,000 shoes or pumps right
Allergic to these weak ass hoes, nigga gesundheit
Miss my Harlem bitch, buss that pussy open in one night
But last time I was out in New York I got in a gunfight
Blowbiz to the showbiz
I kick rap burnin' like kermit sippin' on hoe tears
Million dollar world tour, a nigga with no spins
Everyday I got a new cousin, nigga we no kin
And all this internet shit done fucked up the era
That bitch ain't been the same since 'Ye dropped her off
At the airport
They only gave us 28 days so make em last
The black delegation would like to trade Stacey Dash
For Adele and Margot Robbie, let's get it poppin', we on
Fuck it, even trade, we even throw in a Raven Symone
Filthy Jet Black nigga Backstage full of white bitches
No I don't sell like Macklemore, but I've got White Privilege
Try not to sell no crack no more, tryna stay out the prison
That Heron shit will get your ass a gas price sentence
That snitchin' shit will leave you marked just like a life sentence
That snitchin' shit will get your family and your wife missin'
Play position, these niggas friendly as a box of puppies
I drop big nuts on this game, they holdin' chicken nuggets
My backwood rolled up with dirty, you smell that
Seen myself on Comedy Central, hope they bring Chappelle back
Feds listenin', all this talk about the scale be scaled back
Seen India Love nudes, a nigga trying to nail that
A couple weeks I'm in Toronto I'ma see all my bitches
But all my niggas can't cross the border for that all-star shit
But niggas be creepin' for the weekend, give her that all-star dick
I want that pussy, head, mouth, ass, and all that shit

Cocaine parties in L.A
Throw ya' set up at some more gang parties in L.A
I know some neighborhood Pirus that sell yay (Los Angeles)
I got homies with them pound 6 - o's (R60) and 8 Trays
Nigga shoutout to my Mexican partner, forgot about 'em (Shake that body, party that bod-)
When he come back across the border, we throwin' a powder party
(Shake that body, party that body)
