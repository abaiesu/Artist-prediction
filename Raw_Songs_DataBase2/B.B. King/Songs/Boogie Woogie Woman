I got a boogie-woogie woman
Boogie-woogie all the time
I got a boogie-woogie woman
Boogie-woogie all the time
If she keep on boogyin'
She bound to lose her mind

Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies all night long
Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies all night long
Yes, and the...come
She's still goin' strong

Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies late at night
Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies late at night
Well, I don't mind her boogyin'
'Cause her boogyin' is all right

Well, she's a bogie-woogie woman
And she boogies all the time
Well, she's a bogie-woogie woman
And she boogies all the time
Well, if keep on boogyin'
She bound to lose her mind
