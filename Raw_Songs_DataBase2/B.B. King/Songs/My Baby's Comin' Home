I've lost the blues there's nothing else to lose 
I'm gonna count my twos I'm takin off my shoes 
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 
When I first heard this boy, I did the twist 
My baby's comin home 

The things I did before that made her go 
I ain't doin no more and I'm telling you so 
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 
when I first got her wire boy I thought I would die 
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 

Im meatin allmy planess i'm meatin all my trains 
I'm checkin on the bus boy I'm kickin up a fuss
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 
if she was comin back to you boy you'd be a fool too 
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 

I ain't had what it take to make me shake 
I'm bout to get a break and lose this ole ache 
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 
I'm gonna change my ways i'll be busy for days 
My baby's comin home
