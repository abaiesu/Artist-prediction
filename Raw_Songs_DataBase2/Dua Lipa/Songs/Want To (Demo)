Gimme release
Keep the drugs
Gimme relief
Keep the love, just gimme a piece of that
One piece of that
Give it to me
Don't judge, just give it to me
No heart, no second degree tonight
Run free tonight

I won't stop
Not now
Guess what?
Hella, hella, it's my body right
I go in light
Hella, hella, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

Hella, hella, it's my body
Hella, hella, it's my body

Some people do
But some, they just like to talk (okay)
Some shoot the breeze
But some like to leave a mark (okay)
Some need the light
And some people like the dark (okay, yeah)

I won't stop
Not now
Guess what?
Hella, hella, it's my body right
I go in light
Hella, hella, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

Hella, hella, it's my body
Hella, hella, it's my body

Don't cry for us
No time for us
When we're at some party
When you grab somebody
Don't cry for us
No time for us
When we're at some party
When you grab somebody

I'll dance if I want to
My body, my body, my body
Hella, hella, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Hella, hella, it's my body
My body, my body, my body
Hella, hella, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Hella, hella, it's my body
