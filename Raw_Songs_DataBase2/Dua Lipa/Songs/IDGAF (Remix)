I've been winning since I left you, left you
And you think you sick, now you about to get much sicker
Cause I'm looking in the mirror and that ass got thicker
Beggin' baby, hands is poppin', wrists with six plus figures
I've been there, I've been here, I just hustle low and pray
Got a lot up on my plate, taking meetings in L.A
Glowing up and blowing up, that's what I'm about to do
When it's all been happening since I left you


You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck


How it feel, how it feel, how it feel?
Sign off on our connection, and I sign onto a deal
Shoulda kept a hundred, man, you shoulda kept it real
Cause I realize you fake and you lost all your appeal
It don't hurt when I see you with her
You was always insecure and believed what you heard
Cause you've seen that all these niggas tryna see when it's they turn
But I don't need a cuddle buddy, I just cuddle with my fur


Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
